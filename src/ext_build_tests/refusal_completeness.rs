//! The §3.3 completeness guard for D-244 rule 7's refusal set: every type
//! the `ext` boundary admits at a parameter position emits a refusal arm,
//! and the shim declares exactly the unpack helpers those arms name.
//!
//! `tests/issue_1067_neg004_ext_conformance.rs` pins what a refusal *says*
//! to a host, one shape at a time, through a real CPython. It cannot say
//! that no admitted type was left without an arm at all -- a new carrier
//! added without a refusal path would simply not appear in its table. This
//! file is the closed-set half of that statement, and it is deliberately
//! non-`#[ignore]`d: the coverage job runs `llvm-cov` without
//! `--include-ignored`, so this is where the lines of this change that sit
//! inside `scripts/check_diff_coverage.py`'s denominator are executed.
