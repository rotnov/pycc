/*
 * The fixed half of a pycc `--ext` artifact (D-244, #1025 Part 1).
 *
 * This file is tracked, hand-written, and never generated. `pycc` embeds it
 * with `include_str!` (see `src/ext_build.rs`) and writes it into the build
 * scratch directory next to a small generated companion,
 * `pycc_ext_exports.inc`, which supplies the module name and the per-export
 * wrappers. Both are compiled as one translation unit by the same `cc`
 * invocation that links the artifact -- never during an ordinary
 * `cargo build`, which is what keeps CPython headers off the ordinary build
 * path entirely.
 *
 * Embedded rather than located by source-tree path on purpose: an installed
 * `pycc` has no source tree to look in, so a path-based lookup would work in
 * a checkout and break the moment the compiler is installed.
 *
 * Why C at all, rather than emitting `PyModuleDef`/`PyMethodDef` as LLVM IR:
 * those are exactly the struct layouts the stable ABI exists to hide. Hand-
 * modelling them in IR would re-introduce the version coupling
 * `Py_LIMITED_API` removes.
 *
 * Division of labour with `pycc_rt` (D-244 rule 2): every *decision* about
 * how a value is represented -- the inline-integer range, D-141's bool
 * marker words, the four-way classification of an encoded word, the pending
 * exception's type and message -- belongs to `pycc_rt::ext_bridge` and
 * `pycc_rt::exception`. This file only moves `PyObject*`s according to those
 * answers. That is what keeps `libpycc_rt.a` free of CPython symbols, which
 * matters because the same archive is linked into every `native` executable,
 * where no interpreter exists.
