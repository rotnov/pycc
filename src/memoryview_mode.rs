//! The native-mode gate on a `memoryview` annotation (Part 1 of #1027).
//!
//! A `memoryview` parameter is a borrowed view of storage a CPython
//! interpreter owns: the value only exists because a generated
//! `pycc build --ext` wrapper acquired a `Py_buffer` from a real
//! `memoryview` object and released it again when the call returned
//! (`src/ext_build.rs`'s wrapper generator owns that discipline). A plain
//! `pycc build` produces a standalone native executable with no interpreter
//! at all, so there is nothing to acquire a buffer *from*, and the program
//! is refused here rather than compiled into a signature nothing could ever
//! call.
//!
//! This is a sibling of `src/foreign_import.rs`, and for the same reason:
//! `crates/pycc_hir` and `crates/pycc_types` have no artifact-mode
//! awareness at all, so a refusal that depends on the mode cannot live in
//! either. `src/frontend.rs`'s `resolve_frontend_native` is the one seam
//! that knows.
//!
//! It refuses no miscompile, and that is recorded rather than left for a
//! later reader to rediscover as dead weight: Part 1 adds no expression
//! that *produces* a `memoryview` value (the constructor is still refused),
//! so no call site inside a native program could type-check against such a
//! signature in the first place. The gate exists to make the refusal
//! legible -- a named code, a sentence naming `--ext`, and a test pinning
//! both -- instead of leaving a `memoryview` annotation to fail later with
//! a message about something else.

/// one position can hand one out". The message is worded like those two

/// rather than in any of its three spellings (#1134 added `NDArray`), so a
/// user who wrote `ndarray` or `NDArray` is not told about a `memoryview`
/// they never mentioned. The
/// canonical-spelling rendering `offending_position` does is the *native*
/// path's, whose `I0405` quotes a whole signature position back; this
/// message quotes no annotation text at all.
///
/// Only the return position is checked. A `memoryview` *parameter* on a
/// private function carries no value into codegen either way: for the same
/// reason there is nothing to return, there is nothing to pass, so no call
/// to such a function can be written at all -- whether its body reads the
/// parameter with the `b[i]` load Part 2 of #1027 admits or is refused a
/// `C0001` for reading it any other way. And native mode is not this
/// function's concern --
/// [`refuse_in_native_mode`] refuses both positions there, private
/// functions included.
///
/// Called after `collect_exports`, and handed its result: Part 2b of #1142
/// (#1164) made a buffer return type *carriable*, so the export set is no
/// longer a set this walk can assume was already refused.
///
/// The exemption is exactly "is exported" (#1174). It was once narrower --
/// **exported and module-level**, a dot-free name -- because
/// `pycc_codegen`'s `call_result.rs` holds a `Ty::MemoryView` panic that
/// #1164's completion criteria require to stay unreachable, and `pycc_types`
/// intercepted a buffer-returning *call*
/// (`crate::buffer::buffer_returning_call_unsupported`) only at
/// `HirExpr::Call`, the sole route to a module-level `def`. A method's
/// return type resolves instead through `class::method_call::
/// resolve_method_call`, `class::static_call::
/// resolve_static_or_class_method_call` and `class::super_call::
/// resolve_super_method_call` from `HirExpr::MethodCall`, so `g.make()`
/// inside the artifact would have reached the panic. #1174 extended the
/// interception to all four of those resolver exits
/// (`crate::buffer::refuse_buffer_returning_method`), which is what lets the
/// declaration be admitted here: the panic stays unreachable because every
/// *intra-artifact* route to the return value is refused, not because the
/// method cannot be written.
///
/// What still refuses a declaration is therefore exactly non-membership in
/// the export set, and `collect_exports` owns every reason for that: a
/// private name (leading underscore, on the method or on its class), a
