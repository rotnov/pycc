//! The `--ext` build seam: what a hosted CPython extension artifact needs
//! that a native executable does not (D-244, #1036, Part 1 of #1025).
//!
//! `src/ext_output.rs` already owns *where* the artifact is written and what
//! its module is called. This module owns everything else `try_build`'s ext
//! branch needs:
//!
//! * the CPython toolchain probe (interpreter, header directory, stable-ABI
//!   floor), [`ExtToolchain`];
//! * the per-platform shared-object link argv, [`ExtLinkPlatform`] and
//!   [`ext_link_args`];
//! * the export set and its `C0003` capability gaps, [`collect_exports_with_hooks`];
//! * the generated C companion to the fixed shim, [`generate_exports_inc`]
//!   and [`SHIM_C`].
//!
//! Every item here except [`ExtToolchain::probe`] is a pure function of its
//! arguments. That is deliberate, and it is the same property
//! `src/ext_output.rs` documents for its own contract: the three link arms
//! and both header-resolution failures must be executable from an ordinary
//! unit test on one host, because `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s coverage job
//! runs `llvm-cov` without `--include-ignored` -- an `#[ignore]`d
//! CPython-driven test contributes exactly zero coverage while its lines
//! stay in `scripts/check_diff_coverage.py`'s denominator. A `cfg!(windows)`
//! branch would be just as unexecutable as a `#[cfg]` one is *coverable*,
//! so the platform arms are selected from the resolved **target triple**,
//! never from the building host -- which is also what makes
//! `pycc build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --ext` emit a Windows argv
//! from a macOS host at all.

/// `PyExc_Exception`.
///
/// Selection is `exception_type_tag == Some(t)` with
/// `t >= FIRST_USER_EXCEPTION_TYPE_TAG`. Neither `None` nor a smaller
/// `Some` is a user class: `crates/pycc_hir/src/class.rs` documents that
/// trap directly -- the flat seven builtins carry `None` and every builtin
/// past them carries a fixed `Some` below `FIRST_USER_EXCEPTION_TYPE_TAG`.
/// Group-derived classes are
/// excluded by [`GROUP_EXCEPTION_CLASSES`], and a monomorphized generic
/// specialization is untagged by construction and never appears here.
///
/// Bases come from `def.bases`, never from the linearized `def.mro`:
/// `class E(MyBase, ValueError)` is legal and is caught natively by
/// `except ValueError:`, so taking the first exception ancestor out of the
/// MRO would pick `MyBase` alone and drop `ValueError` -- exactly the
/// host-side mismatch this table exists to remove. A non-exception base (a
/// method-only mixin) is dropped, which `docs/RUNTIME.md` records as a
