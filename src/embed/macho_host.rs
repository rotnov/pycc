//! Pure classification of a closure image's or a native library's Mach-O
//! dependencies (the pycc.lock decision entry, rule 8; #1243 and #1259).
//!
//! Every dependency, absolute or relative, is resolved on the build host
//! from the *source* image's location, the way dyld resolves it there,
//! and then classified by where it resolved rather than by how it is
//! spelled. `@rpath` is searched over the requesting image's own
//! `LC_RPATH` entries only: the images that load a closure image are the
//! source interpreter's on the host and the pycc executable in the bundle,
//! so an rpath inherited from them differs between the two and a reference
//! that needs one is refused. The file-system probe is injected, so every
//! arm here runs without a file system; `native.rs` supplies the host's.
