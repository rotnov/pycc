//! The `--ext` driver's view of receiver-exact inherited-method copies
//! (#1337, D-254).
//!
//! `pycc_types` compiles an inherited body whose behaviour depends on its
//! receiver once more for each subclass that needs it, as an ordinary item
//! spelled like the subclass's own definition (`B.g` for `A.g` compiled for
//! `B`; see `pycc_hir::inherited_copy_name`). The export walk sees those
//! items, but it resolves a published class's members through the class
//! tables, where a copy never appears -- so without this module a host
//! calling `mod.B().g()` would still run `A.g`'s compilation for `A`, the
//! exact miscompile the copies exist to remove.
//!
//! Three questions are answered here, each the ext-side twin of a
//! `pycc_mir` routing site:
//!
//! - which exported item a published class's method table binds for a
//!   member an ancestor owns ([`receiver_exact_export`]);
//! - which compiled `__init__` a host-side construction runs
//!   ([`receiver_exact_init`]);
//! - whether an exported copy is itself publishable ([`copy_export_verdict`]):
//!   a copy is compiled for exactly one receiver class, so it is reachable
//!   only on that class, and a copied `@property` getter is attribute
//!   syntax on the host exactly as an own one is.
