/// consulted the class table would have no mirror-comparable form and the
/// parity test would stop being well-formed. `class_defs` may still be read
/// for *diagnostics*, and [`collect_exports`] layers every HIR-dependent
/// exclusion on top of this verdict -- which makes the mirror a superset of
/// the driver's admitted set, and a superset is harmless here: at worst a
/// thunk is emitted for a name no wrapper calls.
///
/// **Refused as representation, here, lexically:** a monomorphized generic
/// specialization (`0gen_`), a private class or method name, an empty
/// segment, a fourth segment, and `<Class>.<property>.setter` -- a
/// `@property` is attribute syntax on the host side, not a method table
/// entry. #1145 moved the *rest* of the old refusal list into the driver.
/// The bare `<Class>.<method>` spelling covers `MethodKind::Regular`,
/// `PropertyGetter` and `AbstractMethod` at once, and telling them apart
/// needs `HirModule::class_defs`, which this verdict may not see. So it is
/// admitted here and narrowed there: a property getter by
/// `HirClassDef::properties`, and an abstract stub by its class failing
/// [`collect_exports`]' constructibility predicate -- an
/// `@abstractmethod` that survives lowering always belongs to an
/// `is_abstract` class, which is never constructible.
///
/// The `0gen_` refusal is applied to the whole name before the split and
/// takes precedence. That is defense in depth rather than a live hazard:
/// `pycc_types::monomorphize` puts the substitution suffix *last*
/// (`0gen_<Class>.<method>__<P>_<C>`), so a `0gen_` name's final segment is
