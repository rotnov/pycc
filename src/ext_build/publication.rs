/// assigns to `self` is answered by the instance and belongs to no class
/// at all ([`mro_binds_slot`]); every other name is answered by the

/// [`class_member_names`] is what "binds" means -- and that entry alone
/// decides the outcome. If its binding is an
/// export, the method is published; if it is anything the export set does
/// not hold (a `@property` getter, an `@abstractmethod`'s stub, a private
/// or uncarriable member), the name is simply absent from the published
/// class, and the walk never falls through to a base that happens to
/// export the same name. Stopping at the first *exportable* hit instead
/// would publish `Base.value`'s compiled body on a `Derived` whose own
/// `@property value` shadows it -- an artifact that silently disagrees
/// with Python's own attribute lookup (#1146). The rule is kind-blind in
/// both directions, so a derived ordinary method still shadows a base
/// `@property`, and a derived `@staticmethod` still shadows a base
/// instance method, each published under its own receiver kind.
///
/// That direction is the opposite of [`collect_exports`]' `(class, method)`
/// dedup, which keeps the *last* binding because a rebound name is what
/// `Grid.f` means in one class body.
///
/// **Why an inherited method may be published at all.** A base method's
/// compiled body addresses its own class's slot indices, and
/// `crates/pycc_hir/src/class/mro.rs`'s `validate_mro_slot_layout` (#969)
/// rejects with
/// `C0001`, during HIR lowering, every multiple-inheritance shape whose
/// ancestor layout is not a name-wise prefix of the derived one -- see that
/// function's own doc for why. So a base method invoked with a derived
/// instance addresses the same attributes, and this path inherits that
/// invariant rather than restating it.
///
/// **Which classes get a type object.** A publishable class (below) is
/// published when its MRO-resolved set is non-empty *or* it is
/// constructible ([`class_constructible`], D-244 #1145 clause (b)), so an
/// `__init__`-only class -- lark's `ParseConf` (#1450) -- and a class with
/// only the implicit `object.__init__` (`class Empty: pass`, a fields-only
/// dataclass) are published with an empty method table: the host can name
/// them, construct them, and pass the instance to a compiled function. A
/// publishable class that resolves nothing and is not constructible --
/// an `__init__` with an uncarriable parameter, an enum, a Protocol -- still
/// gets no type object, since there is nothing the host could do with one.
/// Neither does a monomorphized generic specialization (`0gen_<Class>__...`)
/// that resolves nothing: it has no `fnptr_` global for a generated
/// `tp_init` to call, and its instances cross as a carrier named after the
/// generic class.
///
/// The class list is the export set's classes in first-export order, then
/// every remaining published class, in `HirModule::class_defs`
/// order: a class with no export of its own has no first-export position,
/// and appending is the only deterministic slot for it. Deterministic is the
/// requirement -- the generated `.inc` must be byte-identical across runs,
/// so neither list is ever built from a hash map.
///
/// A class is publishable when [`is_public_name`] accepts its name and it is
/// not an exception class: [`register_class_c`] already publishes a user
/// exception class under its bare name, and a second `PyModule_AddObjectRef`
/// under that name would replace it. Both are already true of every class in

/// `class Base: def __init__(self, n): self.value = n` combined with
/// `class Derived(Base): def value(self): ...`, where CPython answers the
/// integer and raises `TypeError: 'int' object is not callable`.
///
/// **What this predicate actually tests is broader than that, on purpose.**
/// CPython's precedence is per instance and per construction: a name is in
/// the instance `__dict__` only once an `__init__` that assigns it has
/// run. This predicate asks a static question instead -- does any class
/// linearized in `mro` declare the slot at all -- because a compiled
/// instance has no `__dict__`. Every ancestor layout is a name-wise
/// prefix of the derived one: in a single-inheritance chain by
/// construction, since `crates/pycc_hir/src/class/mro.rs`'s
/// `flat_attr_layout` assigns slots most-base-first, and under multiple
/// inheritance because `validate_mro_slot_layout` (#969) rejects every
/// shape where that would not hold, a single base onto an
/// already-validated ancestor inheriting the property transitively. A
/// slot declared anywhere on the MRO
/// therefore occupies a fixed offset in every subclass whether or not the
/// `__init__` that assigns it is the one a given construction reaches.
/// The two conditions differ exactly where an override's `__init__` skips
/// its base's: for `class Base: def __init__(self): self.value = 5` with a
/// `class Derived(Base)` whose `__init__` calls no `super()` and which
/// declares `def value`, CPython answers `Derived().value()` with `99`
/// while the artifact publishes nothing. That is the direction this walk
/// is willing to be wrong in -- lossy, never a callable Python would not
/// give -- and publishing on a guess is what it exists to avoid.
///
/// The same conservatism covers the one class-namespace kind that beats an
/// instance slot, a `@property`: it is a data descriptor, so it would win
