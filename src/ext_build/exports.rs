/// * a monomorphized generic specialization carries the `0gen_` prefix and

/// * `<Class>.<property>.setter` -- a `@property` is attribute syntax on

/// * a `@property` **getter**, which shares the bare `<Class>.<method>`
///   spelling with an ordinary instance method and is told apart here by
///   `HirClassDef::properties`, whose `getter` field holds exactly that
///   mangled name;
/// * every instance method of a class [`instance_method_reachable`]
///   refuses, which is what removes an `@abstractmethod`'s stub body: such
///   a method survives lowering only on an `is_abstract` class (a class
///   carrying its own `@abstractmethod` without an `ABC` base is rejected
///   with `C0001` by `crates/pycc_hir/src/class.rs`'s unoverridden-abstract
///   check), and that predicate refuses an `is_abstract` class outright --
///   unlike an unconstructible `__init__` shape, which a constructible
///   subclass does rescue. The exclusion story is therefore *"excluded
///   because no host instance can ever receive it"*, never *"excluded
///   because the method is abstract"*.
///
/// Routing any of them through the gap collector instead would turn a
/// public ABC into a build failure on a signature the boundary carries
/// perfectly well.
///
/// A class whose HIR carries an `exception_type_tag` publishes no type
/// object and exports no method. [`register_class_c`] already publishes
/// such a class under its **bare class name** as a module attribute, so a
/// second `PyModule_AddObjectRef` under that name would replace a working
/// exception class with a non-instantiable type -- the host then gets
/// `TypeError: catching classes that do not inherit from BaseException`.
/// The exclusion is scoped on the HIR tag and deliberately *not* on
/// [`collect_user_exception_classes`]' selector, which additionally drops
/// group-derived classes: a `class MyGroup(ExceptionGroup)` is never
/// registered, so scoping there would publish `mod.MyGroup` as a
/// non-instantiable non-`BaseException` type standing in for a user
/// exception class -- the same wrong-published-name defect from the other
/// side. This filter is applied in the driver, layered *on top of*
/// [`classify_export_name`]'s lexical verdict rather than inside it, which
/// keeps that verdict mirror-comparable with
/// `pycc_codegen::is_ext_exportable_name` (work item 8's parity test) and
/// makes the mirror a harmless superset.
///
/// The boundary carries `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str` and a `tuple` of
/// those scalars in either direction, and `None` as a return type only
/// (#1036, #1048, #1049, #1050). `docs/RUNTIME.md`'s admissibility matrix

/// [`EXT_CAPABILITY_CODE`] capability gap, and *all* of them are collected
/// before returning -- one `--ext` build should not have to be re-run once
/// per unsupported function.
///
