/// function adds on top is which published class gets a `Py_tp_init`: a
/// class published only for its methods and not constructible gets a type
/// object the host cannot instantiate.
///
/// The four conditions, each a HIR fact rather than a name pattern:
///
/// 1. the class is not abstract, not a `Protocol` and not an `Enum` --
///    `is_abstract` is what removes an `@abstractmethod`'s stub body, whose
///    lowered `HirItem::Function` returns nothing while its `return_ty` says
///    otherwise, and it removes it *totally*: a class carrying its own
///    `@abstractmethod` without an `ABC` base never reaches codegen at all
///    (`crates/pycc_hir/src/class.rs`'s unoverridden-abstract check rejects
///    it with `C0001`), so every surviving abstract stub belongs to an
///    `is_abstract` class;
/// 2. it carries no `exception_type_tag` and is not a seeded synthetic
///    builtin exception class -- [`register_class_c`] already publishes a
///    user exception class under its bare name, and the flat builtins carry
///    no tag of their own;
/// 3. its MRO-resolved `__init__` ([`resolved_init`]) exists and returns
///    `None` -- an unannotated `__init__` infers `Ty::Infer` and is refused
///    here rather than emitting a constructor whose C return type is
///    unspellable;
/// 4. the receiver-free tail of that `__init__`'s parameters is carriable by
///    [`unsupported_boundary_ty`] and contains no `tuple`.
///
/// Condition 4 **reuses `unsupported_boundary_ty`** rather than re-deriving
/// the predicate, so a constructor's admissibility is literally the same
/// statement as every other export's instead of a second one that drifts
/// (`AGENTS.md`'s canonical-statement rule). It also answers correctly, for
/// free, on the case a hand-written predicate would most likely miss: `def
/// __init__(self, other: Grid)` carries a `Ty::Instance`, which since Part 1
/// of #1447 (#1449) is carried exactly when it names a regular class of this
/// module, so such a class is constructible from a host that already holds
/// a `Grid`, while `def __init__(self, c: Color)` with `Color` an enum keeps
/// the class non-constructible. The extra `tuple` refusal
/// is not a second admissibility rule either: `is_ext_exportable_name`
/// answers `false` for `<Class>.__init__` (its second segment starts with
/// `_`), so `ext_thunk_required` emits no `pycc_ext_thunk_` for a
