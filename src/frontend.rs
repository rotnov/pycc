//! Since #898 (Part 1 of #881, D-222) a "program" is one or more files:

/// `check_and_resolve_all_keyed` runs monomorphization and enum lowering,
/// which rewrite the item list and recompute those positions.
///
/// The foreign-import gate is *reported* after, so a program with both a
/// type error and a foreign import still reports the type error first,
/// exactly as the former `main.rs` call site did -- when no `memoryview`
/// gap fires in the same program. When one does, the early return below
/// reports the collected gaps and the type check never runs at all, so
/// there is no type error to order against. The `memoryview` gate
/// cannot be: `crates/pycc_types`'s `reject_memoryview_read` refuses every
/// *use* of a `memoryview`-typed name with `C0001` except the `b[i]`
/// element load Part 2 of #1027 admits, so a body that so much as reads
/// its own parameter any other way fails the type check first, and the
/// signature-level `I0405` that `docs/RUNTIME.md` and D-244 promise for
/// "a `memoryview` in a signature in a build without `--ext`" would never
/// be emitted (#1115 review round 5). It is therefore reported *before*
/// the type check -- together with any foreign-import gap found in the
/// same program, so prioritizing it never swallows an `I0403` that would
/// otherwise have been reported.
///
/// The buffer-producer gate is the third case (#1165). Its walk is computed
/// before the type check like the others, because the checker admits
/// `a = ndarray(n)` in every artifact mode and so never produces a
/// mode-aware verdict to wait for. Its *report* is then filtered by that
/// same check, per function, through
/// `crate::memoryview_mode::producer_gaps_the_check_admits`: a producer
/// whose length the checker refuses is not an allocation, and reporting
/// `I0405` for it prescribed a remedy `--ext` does not satisfy either.
/// That filter is unconditional -- it applies on every path this function
/// can report a producer gap from, including the `memoryview` early return
/// above, which obtains a verdict *purely* to filter with and discards the
/// verdict's own diagnostics.
///
/// The inventory, because a missed site is exactly how this defect reached
/// review twice: `resolve_frontend_native` has three producer-gap report
/// sites -- the `refused_a_buffer` early return (filtered), the type-check
/// `Err` arm (filtered), and the `Ok(resolved)` tail (provably needs no
/// filter, because reaching it means the check returned `Ok` and so keys no
/// error to any function).
///
/// `pycc check` selects no artifact mode and so runs neither gate:
/// [`check_frontend`] reports the `C0001` read refusal there, which is
/// correct, because `I0405`'s contract is scoped to a *build* without
/// `--ext`.
///
/// The interop policy (#1224) is resolved first, right after linking, so a
