# Agent Session Log

A running handoff log for autonomous agent sessions working toward the
version 0.1 delivery goal (see `docs/DELIVERY_PLAN.md`
for the PR-1 through PR-7 breakdown this tracks against). Distinct from
`docs/AGENT_RETROSPECTIVE.md`: this file is "what state is the work in and
what's next," not "what went wrong." Newest entry first. Entries are
snapshots, not a byte-for-byte transcript — write enough for a fresh
session (human or agent) to resume without re-deriving context from git
history alone, not a full narrative.

## 2026-07-26 — PR #132 blocked on `frontend-perf-gate`; likely order/thermal drift, not a real regression; escalated to the user

**Snapshot evidence:** head `1ae1b3c` (fifth merge round). CI run
[30205958740](https://github.com/rotnov/pycc/actions/runs/30205958740):
every job passed except `frontend-perf-gate`, which failed with
`FAIL: pycc check replicated frontend median regressed 6.1931% (threshold: 2.00%)` —
previous replicate medians `6686.28, 6777.54, 7088.44, 7228.73, 7185.40 ns`,
current replicate medians `8498.72, 7405.25, 7527.44, 8023.83, 7353.21 ns`.
(A first attempt on this same head also failed
`frontend-perf-measure` on a plain DNS lookup failure fetching the Rust
toolchain — pure infra, correctly retried via `gh run rerun --failed`,
unrelated to the finding below.)

**Why this looks like the gate's own known order/thermal-drift gap, not
a PR-5 regression:**
1. `git diff 45545bb...HEAD -- crates/pycc_parser crates/pycc_hir crates/pycc_types benches/ Cargo.toml Cargo.lock rust-toolchain.toml`
   is empty, and neither `pycc_hir` nor `pycc_types`'s `Cargo.toml`
   depends on `pycc_mir`/`pycc_codegen`/`pycc_rt`. The exact code path
   this benchmark measures (`pycc_parser::parse` → `pycc_hir::lower_checked`
   → `pycc_types::check` over a fixed fib/print fixture, all in-process,
   no CLI subprocess spawn) is byte-for-byte identical to the predecessor.
   A real algorithmic regression in the measured path is not possible.
2. The two five-value sets show complete separation: every one of the 5
   current replicates (min `7353.21`) is slower than every one of the 5
   previous replicates (max `7228.73`). Under random per-round noise that
   has roughly a 1-in-252 (~0.4%) chance; a full separation like this
   points to a systematic effect, not noise scattered around a stable
   mean. The measurement order is fixed (all 5 predecessor rounds run
   first, then all 5 candidate rounds) — D-062's own text still runs
   sequentially, and D-056's own text already names "order and thermal
   drift inside one hosted runner" as a gap neither D-051 nor D-062
   removes (interleaving was explicitly rejected on trust-boundary
   grounds: candidate code must not run before the predecessor upload is
   sealed).

**Why not just retry:** D-051/D-056/D-062 all explicitly reject
"rerun until one pair passes" as selection bias, and this session already
burned five merge-conflict rounds while `main` kept advancing during
each CI wait — a retry is also a bet that the same host-level order
effect doesn't recur, not a fix for anything PR-5 controls. Widening the
gate's classifier or changing its measurement order is the concurrent
actor's byte-exact-reviewed CI-workflow domain, not something this PR
can or should patch as a side effect of shipping compiler work.

**Escalated to the user** with the two facts above, and three options:
one documented probe re-run, a D-054-style audited exception for this
one merge, or pausing/adjusting the gate's classifier so this stops
recurring. Full CI check list at
[the failed run](https://github.com/rotnov/pycc/actions/runs/30205958740).
No action taken on the gate itself pending that decision; the fifth
merge round's local verification (tests/clippy/doc/100% coverage/evals)
already passed before this push.

## 2026-07-26 — Third D-062 collision resolved; PR #132 re-pushed, awaiting CI

**Snapshot evidence:** direct work on `feat/v0-1-pr5-codegen-depth`,
merging `origin/main` at `841048e` (PR #128, which added this file and
`docs/AGENT_RETROSPECTIVE.md` under D-066) into this branch and pushing
the result as commit `1b68e21` (superseded by a second merge commit
resolving the immediately-following conflict described below). Local
`cargo test --workspace`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets`,
`cargo doc --workspace --no-deps`, and
`cargo llvm-cov --workspace --fail-under-lines 100 --fail-under-regions 100`
all passed (100.00% lines and regions across every crate) before pushing.

**What changed since the entry below:** the prior entry's "Known
follow-up required before PR-5 merges" predicted a colliding tail between
this branch's D-062 (str-leak correction) and `main`'s new D-062
(fixed-replicate perf-gate stabilization). Resolved by keeping D-057–061
as `main` had already reserved them, ceding D-062 (and `main`'s
subsequently added D-066, this file's own decision) to `main`'s
decisions, and renumbering this branch's remaining four entries — str-leak
correction, the renumbering-record itself, the `print()`-nested-expression
boundary, and the `RelocMode::PIC` fix — to D-070 through D-073, a gap
ahead of `main`'s reach chosen so future `main` advances stop colliding
with this branch's own IDs before it merges. The renumbering-record entry
(now D-071) was also frozen to a single dense table row instead of a full
section, since three collisions made it the highest-churn entry in the
file for no technical content. A second, smaller conflict round
immediately followed (`main` advanced again mid-resolution, touching the
same `ROADMAP.md`/`SPEC.md` table rows this branch had just edited); it
required no further ID changes, only combining both sides' additive text.

**Known follow-up required before PR-5 merges:** re-check
`gh pr view 132 --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus` and `gh pr checks 132`
after this push lands, since `main` has advanced during every prior
verification window on this branch. Re-verify the live ADR tail
immediately before picking any new ID; later IDs are candidates, not
reservations, and this has now happened four times.

## 2026-07-26 — D-062 activation PR #137 green; refresh onto current main in progress

**Snapshot evidence:** draft [PR #137](https://github.com/rotnov/pycc/pull/137)
at head `b6f5a29d4c56d65d88d82120595bbc04343c6f25` was based on
`e433b849ef1083c0af7aa6da6c022a6e0661dc9f`. Its first complete CI run
`30204610811` and every required check passed, Codex reported no major
issues for that exact head, and the PR had no review threads. While the
run completed, PR #128 advanced `main` to
`841048ec37e20d85a5a0406778f9ec8b66224b04`; the activation worktree is
therefore integrating that exact default-branch commit before review and
merge. This containing snapshot includes the resolved documentation from
that integration but does not itself claim that PR #137 has merged.

**Performance-gate state:** PR #137 activates the staged D-062 workflow
byte-for-byte and retires D-056's live workflow digest while preserving
its identical-input telemetry rule. The first unselected 5+5 PR artifacts
are `frontend-perf-previous` ID `8632698165` and
`frontend-perf-current` ID `8632713088`, retained for 90 days. Their five
per-run medians aggregate to `6869.56 ns -> 6967.66 ns` (`+1.4281%`). The
exact base/head diff contains no `src/` or `crates/` change, so the trusted
classifier reports identical executable inputs; the comparator also falls
within 2% if evaluated as changed. This validates byte-exact execution and
fixed evidence handling, but does not exercise the blocking changed-input
path.

**Required next steps:** finish the non-force merge of current `main`,
rerun focused local policy/site checks, push the new head, run the review
retry checker before requesting Codex review for that SHA, and merge only
after the repeated required checks are green with no unresolved threads.
Then verify the post-merge `main` CI and history audit. Keep issue #109
open until repeated changed-source PR and post-merge runs validate D-062's
blocking aggregate without result selection. PR #132 is a likely future
changed-source observation only after it rebases; its unrelated draft
D-062 through D-065 ADR range currently collides with `main`, and the
renumbering finding is recorded on that PR. **Update from the entry
above:** by the time PR #137 merged (as `45545bb`), PR #132 had already
resolved that collision (D-057–061 kept, D-062 ceded to `main`, remaining
four entries moved to D-070–073) — this entry's last sentence is
superseded, kept verbatim below as the historical record it actually was
at the time it was written.

## 2026-07-26 — PR-5 integration and PR loop pending; PR-6/PR-7 not started

**Snapshot evidence:** read-only inspection of
`feat/v0-1-pr5-codegen-depth` at commit `c70ac56`; its worktree was clean.
The branch is not merged and has no open pull request as of this snapshot.

**Overall status:** PR-1 through PR-4 are merged to `main`. The default-
branch snapshot is `619d232` (the merge of PR #130) and includes the later
infrastructure, governance, performance-gate, and agent-tooling changes.
PR-5 remains in progress on branch `feat/v0-1-pr5-codegen-depth`,
following that branch's complete 11-task version of
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-25-pr5-codegen-depth.md`; the version in
the containing `main` snapshot has only Tasks 1–2.

**PR-5 task status:** all 11 planned tasks have implementation commits.
The observed head follows Task 11's end-to-end fixture/documentation sweep
and its review fixes with a commit that adds the top-level-return
terminator guard and clears the recorded deferred minors. Current-`main`
integration, ADR renumbering, full current-base validation, PR creation,
and the PR review loop have not yet completed.

**Known follow-up required before PR-5 merges:** integrate the latest
`main` without overwriting any newer local work. Published PR #132 now
carries D-057 through D-065, while current `main` owns a conflicting
D-062 and this journal uses D-066. PR #132 must reconcile that colliding
tail before merge. Re-check the live ADR tail immediately before editing;
later IDs are candidates, not reservations. Full detail is in
`docs/AGENT_RETROSPECTIVE.md`.

**After PR-5 merges:** PR-6 (conformance and acceptance benchmarking —
`pycc_testkit`, `fib`/`mandelbrot-ascii` vs. pinned CPython on all 5
Tier-1 targets, the `pycc check` <50ms/1k-LOC benchmark, and exact
diagnostic-output acceptance) and PR-7 (buffer to close whatever's left
against the v0.1 acceptance checklist) have not been started. The paired
frontend regression gate is already active and required through
`ci-gate` under D-056 in the containing commit; D-051/D-053 remain the
retained paired-provenance controls, not the current workflow/comparator
authorization. The gate is not deferred PR-6 work. PR-6 is the first point
the full pipeline runs end-to-end on all five Tier-1 platforms — treat it
as the highest-uncertainty remaining slice, not a formality.

**PR-5 recovery boundary:** the local-only state above is historical, not
the current recovery path. A later read-only check found the snapshot commit
in the ancestry of published branch
`origin/feat/v0-1-pr5-codegen-depth`, with observed remote head
`453e7dd9b23effe0390770d8ad7c264c33150bdd` and open
[PR #132](https://github.com/rotnov/pycc/pull/132) based on
`main@6ec86a8e89c7775f9f41a9aa9b12a1a2660952de`. A clean clone can recover
the work without any machine-local path:

```sh
git fetch --prune origin main feat/v0-1-pr5-codegen-depth
git rev-parse origin/main origin/feat/v0-1-pr5-codegen-depth
git merge-base --is-ancestor \
  c70ac5696ff908770350a587ed87210cd6edd80b \
  origin/feat/v0-1-pr5-codegen-depth
git log --oneline --decorate \
  origin/main..origin/feat/v0-1-pr5-codegen-depth
```

The exact historical snapshot remains
`c70ac5696ff908770350a587ed87210cd6edd80b`. If the published head differs
from the observed head above, treat the remote and PR as newer state: inspect
them before acting and never reset, force-push, or overwrite an existing
owner's local worktree to recreate this older snapshot.

**Where to look to resume:**
- Read [PR #132](https://github.com/rotnov/pycc/pull/132) and compare its
  current remote head with the observed head above. If an existing PR-5
  worktree is present, run `git status --short --branch` there before any
  mutation; never use this snapshot to overwrite newer local work.
- `docs/DELIVERY_PLAN.md` — PR breakdown and autonomy policy.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — current delivery status and the v0.1 acceptance
  checklist (source of truth for what's actually done vs. claimed).
- `git show origin/feat/v0-1-pr5-codegen-depth:docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-25-pr5-codegen-depth.md`
  — the branch's complete active plan, task-by-task, if PR-5 is not merged
  yet; do not mistake the shorter `main` copy for the whole plan.
- `git log --oneline origin/main..origin/feat/v0-1-pr5-codegen-depth`
  for the published commit-by-commit state.
