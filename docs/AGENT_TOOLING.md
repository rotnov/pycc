# Agent tooling supply-chain policy

Repository-scoped agent instructions and plugins are executable control-plane inputs.
They must be reproducible, reviewed, and rollbackable just like compiler dependencies.

## Current pins

| Surface | Dependency | Pin | Automatic updates |
|---|---|---|---|
| Codex | `ievo@ievo-skills` | commit `7d5f3e12d0556cb6c5df2974e2babe0433674186` (`v0.58.1`) | disabled by immutable source |
| Codex | `pycc-agent-skills@ievo-skills` | current repository revision | refreshed explicitly by bootstrap |
| Claude Code | `ievo@ievo-skills` | commit `7d5f3e12d0556cb6c5df2974e2babe0433674186` (`v0.58.1`) | `autoUpdate: false` |

The Codex pin lives in `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`. The Claude Code pin is the
`sha` of the `git-subdir` plugin source inside the inline settings marketplace in
`.claude/settings.json`. Marketplace `ref` values only support branches and tags, so
the exact commit belongs on the plugin source instead. Both surfaces resolve the same
immutable commit rather than trusting a movable release tag. A fresh Codex checkout
is bootstrapped explicitly:

```sh
./scripts/bootstrap-agent-tools.sh
```

Codex does not implicitly register a repository-local marketplace. The bootstrap
script replaces a same-named registration from another checkout, registers this
repository as the marketplace, and installs the pinned iEvo plugin plus the
repository-owned `pycc-agent-skills` plugin. The latter contains thin Codex entry
points that always load the canonical workflow bodies from `.claude/skills/`; CI
requires the two skill sets and their discovery metadata to stay in lockstep.
Claude Code reads the project-scoped marketplace declaration after the repository is
trusted and enables the configured plugin without enabling automatic updates.
The `Agent assets` workflow repeats the validators plus isolated Codex and Claude Code
checks on every pull request and push to `main`. Claude Code validates the project
settings and the extracted inline marketplace with its strict manifest validator, so
a developer's global plugin installation cannot mask a broken repository pin or
marketplace declaration.

## Reviewed update process

1. Open a dependency pull request that changes both pins to the same upstream release.
   Include the old and new commits and link the upstream release notes or changelog.
2. Run the iEvo security-check workflow against the candidate release before accepting
   it. Record its verdict and any reviewed exceptions in the pull request.
3. Review the plugin and skill diff, paying particular attention to instructions,
   hooks, external writes, shell commands, network access, and newly introduced
   dependencies.
4. Run:

   ```sh
   python3 scripts/validate_agent_assets.py
   ./scripts/check-codex-marketplace.sh
   ./scripts/check-claude-marketplace.sh
   ```

5. Merge only through the normal reviewed pull-request and required-CI path.

No scheduled job, startup hook, or local bootstrap command may rewrite these pins.

## Rollback

Revert both pin changes to the last reviewed release, rerun the two validation
commands, and rerun `./scripts/bootstrap-agent-tools.sh` to refresh the local Codex
installation. If the candidate release executed unsafe hooks, disable the plugin until
the rollback is complete and rotate any credential that the hook could have observed.

The last known-good commit and release are present in Git history, so rollback never
depends on a mutable upstream branch or tag lookup.
