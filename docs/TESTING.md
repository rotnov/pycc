# pycc Testing Specification

Testing *is* the spec enforcement mechanism: [PYTHON_STANDARDS.md](./PYTHON_STANDARDS.md) defines what must work; this file defines how we prove it — on every Tier-1 platform, every commit.

## Layers

| Layer | Location | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Unit (Rust) | per-crate `#[cfg(test)]` | lexer/parser/checker/MIR internals |
| 2. Conformance | `tests/conformance/pyXY/` | one test per PEP: compile with pycc, run, `stdout == CPython 3.14 stdout` |
| 3. Diagnostics | `tests/diagnostics/` | rejected constructs fail with the exact code + span (insta-style snapshots) |
| 4. Differential fuzzing | `tests/fuzz/` | generated typed-Python programs: pycc binary output ≡ CPython output; crashes/mismatches auto-minimized |
| 5. Runtime property tests | `pycc_rt` proptest | str/list/dict/RC/cycle-collector invariants |
| 6. Corpus (OSS projects) | nightly CI | real code compiles and its own test suite passes |
| 7. Benchmarks | `benches/` + pyperformance subset | compiler speed + generated-code speed |

## Conformance harness (`pycc_testkit`)

- Each test = single `.py` file, header comment: PEP, category, min pycc milestone.
- Runner: compile (`--debug` and `--release` both) → execute → diff vs CPython 3.14 reference output (recorded, pinned CPython version; re-recorded on CPython patch bumps).
- A PEP flips to ✅ in PYTHON_STANDARDS.md **only** when green on all Tier-1 targets in both profiles. The matrix file is updated by CI, not by hand.

## Differential fuzzing

Generator produces well-typed programs (type-directed generation — always compile-clean), weighted toward: arithmetic edges (overflow → bigint promotion paths), string unicode edges, collection aliasing, control-flow + exceptions, match patterns. Mismatch → auto-minimize (creduce-style) → auto-file issue with repro. Runs continuously on a dedicated runner.

## Corpus: open-source projects as integration tests

Tiers and gates in PYTHON_STANDARDS.md § Real-world corpus. Mechanics:

- Pinned commit per project; `pycc build` the package, run its pytest suite against the compiled artifact (test files themselves compiled where possible; interop fallback allowed and measured).
- Per-project dashboard: % files compiled, % tests passed, RC-elision rate, binary size, speed vs CPython on the project's own benchmarks.
- Regression vs previous release = release blocker.

## The bot

GitHub Action (`corpus-bot`):

1. Nightly: run corpus + a rotating slice of top-PyPI packages (by download count) in compile-only mode.
2. New failure → fingerprint (diagnostic code + normalized span + package) → dedupe → auto-file issue **in the pycc repo**: minimized repro, diagnostic output, PEP link, dashboard delta. Labels: `corpus`, `regression`/`gap`.
3. Fix confirmed → bot closes the issue with the passing run linked.
4. Upstream bugs pycc finds (genuine type errors in the project): bot drafts the report, human reviews and files — never automated spam.

## Benchmarks

- Compiler: `pycc check` LOC/s, cold + incremental build times; tracked per-commit (criterion + CI history), >2% regression fails PR.
- Generated code: pyperformance subset + fib/nbody/spectral-norm vs CPython 3.14, Nuitka, Codon, mypyc; published table per release. Honesty rule: publish losses too.

## Meta

Every bug that reaches `main` gets a permanent regression test named after the issue (`tests/regress/issue_1234.py`). Coverage gate: conformance suite must touch 100% of implemented grammar productions (grammar-coverage instrumentation in the parser).
