# D-091: composed correction/extension of D-090's own staged-but-never-
# activated content, discovered while opening PR-8's real pull request
# against `main`. Independent fixes, bundled into one digest since all
# must land before PR-8's `ci.yml` can activate correctly:
#
# 1. `frontend-perf-measure`'s "Verify exact benchmark revisions" step
#    previously hard-required root Cargo.toml/Cargo.lock (and, via a
#    separate digest, every crate's own Cargo.toml/build.rs) to be
#    byte-identical between the predecessor and candidate commits,
#    aborting the job on any diff. That conflated two different
#    guarantees: the benchmark corpus and toolchain (`benches`,
#    `rust-toolchain*`, `.cargo`) measure genuinely incomparable work if
#    they differ, so those stay a hard abort -- but a dependency-manifest
#    change is just another kind of "did the code that produces the
#    benchmarked binary change," already handled correctly by the
#    existing `executable_inputs_equal` classification and its real 2%
#    regression threshold for src/crates changes. A dependency `pycc
#    check` never invokes at runtime cannot confound the comparison, and
#    if a manifest change did somehow shift timing, the same strict
#    threshold already applied to any other executable-input change
#    would still catch it -- so this does not weaken the gate's power to
#    catch real regressions, it only stops aborting before attempting the
#    comparison at all. Moves Cargo.toml/Cargo.lock into that
#    classification instead.
# 2. A separate, standalone check (not part of `contract_paths` above,
#    and not removed by (1)) keeps root Cargo.toml's bench-defining tail
#    ([dev-dependencies] onward, i.e. [dev-dependencies] plus [[bench]]
#    today) a hard abort: nothing in that region reaches the benchmarked
#    binary, so relaxing it would let a bumped `criterion` or rewritten
#    `[[bench]]` target pass as a faster compiler rather than a faster
#    measuring apparatus. Two invariants are asserted so a future
#    manifest reorder cannot silently widen or narrow the pinned region:
#    every section after [dev-dependencies] must be [[bench]] (else
#    something unrelated could be swallowed into the softer
#    classification), and every [[bench]] in the file must be inside
#    that tail (else moving [[bench]] above [dev-dependencies] could
#    move it out of the pinned region). `Cargo.lock`'s own bench-tooling
#    entries are not isolated by this check and remain in the soft
#    classification -- an accepted, documented residual, not an
#    oversight.
# 3. Root-level `build.rs` (not present today, but previously covered by
#    the removed `**/build.rs` digest for any crate) is added to the
#    `executable_inputs_equal` classification loop, guarded the same way
#    `contract_paths` already guards nonexistent paths, so Cargo silently
#    picking up a future root build script cannot go unclassified.
#    Per-crate `build.rs` stays covered by the existing whole-directory
#    `crates` diff.
# 4. `build-test-coverage`'s "Hard coverage gate" step builds `pycc_rt`
#    for its cross-compile target and in debug profile inside its
#    isolated `nobody` sandbox, but never in release profile -- D-090's
#    own release-profile build step ran only later, outside that
#    sandbox, after coverage measurement. `tests/pycc_toml_release_
#    default.rs`'s non-ignored test needs a release-built `pycc_rt` to
#    exist, so it would fail every time coverage runs. Fix: build
#    `pycc_rt --release` inside the same isolated sandbox, before
#    `llvm-cov` runs -- landing at `$ISOLATED_ROOT/target/release`, which
#    `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/target`'s own symlink already exposes at exactly
#    the `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")`-relative path
#    `find_pycc_rt_lib_dir` looks up.
#
# Items 2 (bench-manifest tail) and 3 (build.rs) were flagged by GitHub's
# automated review (`chatgpt-codex-connector`) on PR #189 before merge and
# folded into this same digest rather than filed as follow-ups.

# D-091: `build-test-coverage`'s own isolated sandbox additionally builds a

# `coverage_gate_present?`/`workflow-policy.yml`'s `pull_request_target`
# audit reaches this exact step body under the identical base-branch-only
# trust boundary `REVIEWED_PERF_CI_WORKFLOW_SHA256S` exists for, so this
# needed the same coexist-then-retire treatment as that digest array while
# `ci.yml` still had the pre-D91 shape. v0.2 PR-8's own merge is that later
# activation commit: `ci.yml` now matches the D91 shape exactly, so
# `COVERAGE_SCRIPT`/`TRUSTED_COVERAGE_STEPS` (the pre-D91 shape) are kept
# defined below only as historical audit fixtures, the same way D51/D56/D62/
# D80's own retired constants are kept -- `REVIEWED_COVERAGE_SCRIPTS`/
# `REVIEWED_TRUSTED_COVERAGE_STEPS` accept only the D91 shape now.

# push-only, and has unprivileged (contents: read) permissions.  Unlike
# the paired-perf lifecycle validators above, this one does NOT compare
# the job against a frozen constant -- the pages-performance job's own
# steps (Lighthouse version, thresholds, artifact uploads) are reviewed
# separately by check_pages_performance_budget.rb's own test suite, so
# this validator only enforces the structural invariants that keep it
