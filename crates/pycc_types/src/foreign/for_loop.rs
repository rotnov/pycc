    // The loop variable holds each item as another opaque
    // `PyObject *`. It is bound directly rather than through
    // `check_assignment`: that function's K1 guard now refuses an
    // object binding only inside a function body (#1325), and the
    // target guards below are this construct's own -- they name the
    // `for` target in their help text, which `check_assignment`'s
    // generic reassignment diagnostics would not.
    // A loop target that already names a binding of some *other*
    // type is refused rather than overwritten. `env.bind` overwrites,
    // so without this guard `x = 5` followed by `for x in <object>:`
    // would leave `x` as `Ty::Object` for the rest of the module
    // while the reads above it stay `Ty::Int` -- and `pycc_codegen`
    // allocates exactly one storage slot per name per function
    // (`collect_stmt_bindings`), asserting at every scalar read that
    // the slot's type still equals the expression's
    // (`local type drifted`). One name with two types is therefore
    // unrepresentable downstream: whichever type won the slot, the
    // other access site would either trip that assertion or -- since
    // it is a `debug_assert`, compiled out in release -- silently
    // store a `PyObject *` into an `i64` slot. Refusing the shape in
    // the checker is the only resolution that leaves no program
    // compiling to wrong code. `T0023` is reused rather than a new
    // code minted: a `for` target *is* an assignment in Python, and
    // the message ("cannot assign ... previously inferred as ...")
    // describes this rebinding exactly. The mirror case -- the loop
    // first, then `x = 5` -- already reports `T0023` from
    // `check_assignment`, so this makes the pair symmetric.
    // A *declared but never assigned* target is the other half of
    // the same rule, and `lookup_any` does not see it: `x: int`
    // puts `x` in `declared`, not `bindings`. `check_assignment`
    // consults `declared_ty` for exactly this case and reports
    // `T0026`, and a `for` target is an assignment, so it reports
    // the same. The refusal is unconditional because no declared
    // type can accept an object item: `object` is not a writable
    // annotation (`pycc_hir` refuses it with `C0001`), so
    // `declared_ty` never yields `Ty::Object`. A value-less
    // `Final[int]` declaration lands here too rather than in
    // `T0045`, which only fires once the name has a runtime value.
