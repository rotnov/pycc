//! Part 2a of #1371: checking `HirExpr::ExprCall`, a positional call whose
//! callee is a subscript result (`callbacks[k](tok)`).
//!
//! HIR lowers a subscript callee to this node whenever the call is not a
//! generic class instantiation (`pycc_hir`'s `expr::subscript_call`). The
//! one admitted shape is a call of a CPython object: the callee infers to
//! `Ty::Object` (an object subscript load, Part 3 of #1026), every argument
//! is packable (`check_object_call_args`, shared with the method-call and
//! direct-call shapes), and the result is another opaque `Ty::Object`.
//! Every other callee keeps the `C0001` HIR reported for this shape before
//! Part 2a, reworded to name the newly admitted case; it is reported at the
//! type stage's own position until Part 5 of #1371 threads spans here.
