//! A list display bound to a CPython object slot, `x: object = [a, b]`
//! (Part 2d of #1371, D-258 rule 4).
//!
//! The empty-container pre-pass (`crate::empty_container`) rewrites a list
//! display it resolves to an object slot into [`pycc_hir::HirExpr::ObjectList`];
//! this module types that node. Codegen builds a fresh CPython `list` and
//! boxes each element through a `pycc_ext_obj_pack_*` helper, so every
//! element must be one the shim can box ([`super::is_object_operand`]:
//! `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, another object or, since #1470, an
//! instance of a regular user class, which crosses as its carrier). Any
//! other element type -- a pycc container, an enum member, an exception
//! instance or `None` -- has no boundary representation yet and is refused
//! with
//! [`super::object_operation_unsupported`], naming the first offending
//! element in source order. The elements need not share a type: a CPython
//! list is heterogeneous, so D-105's homogeneity rule (`T0032`) does not
//! apply to this node.
