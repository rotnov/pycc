//! Part 11 of #1371: `type(o)` on a CPython object, and `is` chains over
//! one.
//!
//! `type(o)` with one object argument is typed as an `object` by both the
//! checker (`crate::expr`) and the solver (`crate::constraints`, reached by
//! an unannotated return); every other `type(...)` shape keeps its
//! `C0001`. An `is`/`is not` chain now reaches the checker, which refuses
//! one with an object operand with the `I0404` every other object chain
//! gets. The fixture helpers are copied from `foreign/raise_tests.rs`
//! because a sibling module cannot reach them.
