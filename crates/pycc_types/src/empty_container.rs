//! Empty-container element-type resolution (#1021, D-245).
//!
//! An empty `[]` or `{}` carries no element type of its own, and this
//! compiler has no bidirectional/expected-type inference to hand one down
//! from the surrounding context. Before this pass existed, *every* empty
//! container literal was a hard error -- including the annotated
//! `xs: list[int] = []` form (#927).
//!
//! This module is the single place that resolves one. It is an infallible
//! HIR-to-HIR rewrite that runs **once, at the top of both
//! [`crate::check_all_keyed`] and [`crate::check_and_resolve_all_keyed`]**,
//! replacing a resolvable `HirExpr::ListLiteral(vec![])` with
//! [`HirExpr::EmptyList`] and a resolvable `HirExpr::DictLiteral(vec![])`
//! with [`HirExpr::EmptyDict`]. Running *before* checking, rather than as a
//! post-check resolve phase, is what makes the pass's key safety property
//! structural instead of merely asserted: `pycc check` and `pycc build`
//! consume the identical rewritten module, so `pycc check` cannot accept a
//! program that `pycc build` then panics on in `MirExpr::ty()`. See
//! `docs/decisions/D-245-*.md` for the alternatives this rejected.
//!
//! The element type comes from exactly three sources, in priority order:
//!
//! 1. the annotation on an `AnnAssign` target (`xs: list[int] = []`) --
//!    purely syntactic, needing no environment at all;
//! 2. *any* successfully-inferred binding for the target anywhere in the
//!    enclosing function -- not only one that precedes the literal;
//! 3. a forward scan of the enclosing function body for the first
//!    *producer* use of the target -- `xs.append(v)` or `d[k] = v`, in
//!    statement position only (see [`find_producer`]). The scan descends into
//!    every block statement the rewrite walk itself descends into, so the two
//!    halves of the pass never disagree about which statements exist.
//!
//! Sources 2 and 3 are best-effort: they use the same
//! `bind_local_types_in_body` pre-pass environment the protocol
//! monomorphization pass already builds, and they swallow inference
//! failures exactly as that function does. A container this pass cannot
//! resolve is left as the empty literal it was, and the check phase then
//! reports `T0003`.
//!
//! **Source 2 is order-insensitive, not a backward scan.** The whole-function
//! environment is built by a single forward `bind_local_types_in_body` pass
//! that completes *before* any rewriting, and is then reused for every
//! occurrence regardless of position, so `xs = [1]; ...; xs = []` and
//! `xs = []; xs = [1]; ...` resolve identically. That is safe because this
//! pass resolves but never accepts: `pycc_hir::check_container_ty` admits
//! only `list[int]` and `dict[str, int]`, so a resolution is either the one
//! element type the program could have compiled with or a `T0034`/`T0036`,
//! and the check phase re-validates the function in true program order
//! (D-040's sticky-representation rule included). Restricting source 2 to
//! strictly-prior bindings could only turn some compilable programs into
//! `T0003`; it could not change which accepted program is produced. The
//! "only a fully concrete `Ty` is ever stored" invariant is enforced here, by
//! [`resolve`] discarding any resolution containing `Ty::Infer` -- the
//! private-helper solver's placeholder, which this pass can observe because
//! it runs before that solver and which nothing downstream substitutes into a
//! rewritten node.
//!
//! The same completed-before-rewriting property is why
//! `bind_local_types_in_stmt`'s `AnnAssign` arm seeds the declared annotation
//! when the value does not infer: `xs: list[int] = []`'s raw literal is not
//! yet rewritten when the environment is built, so without that fallback the
//! environment never learned `xs: list[int]` and a resolution derived from
//! `xs` (`for x in xs: ys.append(x)`) reported a spurious `T0003`.
//!
//! **Producers, not consumers.** `for x in xs`, `xs[0]`, `len(xs)` and
//! `xs.pop()` *read* an element type that is already known; in a single
//! forward synthesis pass with no backward unification they cannot supply
//! one. Only `HirExpr::ListAppend` and `HirStmt::DictSet` can. `HirExpr::
//! SetAdd` is structurally dead as a producer -- `{}` parses as a dict and
//! `set()` is rejected at `pycc_hir` lowering -- so there is deliberately no
//! set path here at all.
//!
//! **Scope.** Function bodies only (class methods included: they lower to
//! ordinary mangled `HirItem::Function` items). Module-level statements keep
//! failing, now with `T0003`.
//!
//! Within a function body the pass walks *every* block statement this HIR has
//! -- `if`/`else`, `while`, both `for` forms, every `match` case body, and
//! every `try`/`except`/`except*`/`else`/`finally` suite (see
//! [`nested_bodies`]) -- so source 1, which is purely syntactic and reads no
//! environment at all, works identically at any nesting depth.
//!
//! Sources 2 and 3 are the ones that do not, and they share one cause rather
//! than differing: both read the flat whole-function `Environment` built by
//! `bind_local_types_in_body`, a pre-existing pass shared with protocol
//! monomorphization whose own statement walk has no `match`/`try` arm. Source
//! 2 reads a binding out of that environment directly; source 3 infers the
//! producer's value *in* it ([`find_producer`] calls `infer_expr_in` with
//! exactly that environment). So a name bound only inside a `match` case or a
//! `try` suite is invisible to both, and `case y: xs = []; xs.append(y)` is
//! not resolved even though `case y: xs: list[int] = []; xs.append(y)` is.
//! That costs a missed resolution, never a wrong element type, and widening a
//! shared pass belongs to its own change rather than to this one.
//!
//! What a miss then *reports* is not always `T0003`. A miss leaves the
//! concrete path failing, which routes the module into the private-helper
//! constraint solver, whose own `HirStmt::Match` arm never binds a pattern's
//! capture names into the case environment -- so the capture is reported as
//! `T0021` with the "local name is not bound before this use" message,
//! and D-220's
//! solver-first merge lets that win over the true `T0003`. That solver
//! behavior predates this pass (`origin/main` emits the identical diagnostic
//! for the same program, and for a `match` program containing no empty
//! container at all) and is untouched here; it is tracked as issue #1046.
