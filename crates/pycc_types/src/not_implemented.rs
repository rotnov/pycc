//! The `T0022` help for a comparison method whose `return NotImplemented`
//! widened its return to the CPython object (#1418).
//!
//! `pycc_hir`'s `class::method::lower_method` widens such a method's return
//! type to `Ty::Object` whatever its annotation says, as CPython's own
//! behaviour does. A native `return self.v == other.v` in the same body then
//! meets that `object` return with a `bool` and is refused as an ordinary
//! `T0022` -- boxing a native value into the object is #1387's work -- but
//! the bare "expected `object`, found `bool`" would leave the programmer who
//! wrote `-> bool` wondering where the `object` came from. Both phases'
//! per-function loops (the solver's in `constraints::signatures` and the
//! check phase's in `crate::module`) route a body's refusal through
//! [`widened_return_help`], so the help is attached whichever phase reports
//! first.
