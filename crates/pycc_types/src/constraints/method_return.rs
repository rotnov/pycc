//! The constraint solver's term for a method call on a user-class instance
//! (#1420): `recv.m(args)` answers the return term of the method `m` that
//! `recv`'s class resolves it to, so an unannotated method whose body is
//! `return self.copy()` infers its return from `copy`'s.
//!
//! The method is found the way the check phase's `resolve_method_call`
//! finds it -- the first class in the receiver class's MRO whose `methods`
//! table names it -- and its signature is the one `signatures` already
//! holds for the mangled name, so an annotated method contributes its
//! declared return and an unannotated one its own inference variable.
//! Nothing here walks the callee's body: the call only links two terms in
//! the union-find, so recursion (`return self.f()` inside `f`) and mutual
//! recursion cannot loop. They leave the return variable unresolved, and
//! signature materialization reports the usual `T0021`.
//!
//! The receiver term must already be a concrete `Ok(Ty::Instance(_))` --
//! `self`, an annotated parameter, or a local bound from one. A solver
//! variable that might later resolve to an instance is deliberately not
//! consulted through `resolved_term`, on `object_lift`'s reasoning: whether
//! it is resolved yet depends on the order the helpers appear in the
//! source, so the inference would too. Every receiver this module does not
//! answer for -- a protocol, `super()`, a method in no `methods` table (a
//! `@staticmethod` or `@classmethod` lives in its own table) -- keeps the
//! `MethodCall` arm's historical "no term", and the check phase stays the
//! authority on whether the call is valid at all.
//!
//! Split out of `constraints.rs` per AGENTS.md's file-decomposition rule,
//! so that file only gains the call site.
