//! The constraint solver's two `object` lifts added by Part 1 of #1333: a
//! method call on a CPython object, and a call of a name bound to one.
//!
//! Both answer the concrete `object` term only when the receiver's or
//! callee's term is *already* `Ok(Ty::Object)` -- a foreign import, a
//! module-level object global, or a local bound directly from one of those.
//! A solver variable that might later resolve to `object` (an unannotated
//! helper's parameter, or a local bound from another helper's result) is
//! deliberately not consulted through `resolved_term`: whether that variable
//! is resolved yet depends on the order the helpers appear in the source, so
//! admission would too. Those shapes are Part 3 of #1333 (#1364) and keep
//! their `T0021`.
//!
//! Split out of `constraints.rs` per AGENTS.md's file-decomposition rule, so
//! that file only gains the two call sites.
