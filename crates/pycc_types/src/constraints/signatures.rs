///
/// **Every mangled name any bound class's `methods`, `properties` (getter

/// through [`Environment::lookup_function`].** The trailing
/// [`crate::class::bind_classes`] call records every class member
/// unconditionally, and the class resolvers (`resolve_method_call`,
/// `resolve_attr_get`'s property arm, `resolve_static_call`,
/// `resolve_class_method_call`, `resolve_instantiation`) *panic* when a
/// table entry has no ordinary-function registration. So the registry may
/// not be a subset of the class tables, and a function whose signature
/// still carries `Ty::Infer` is registered with that `Ty::Infer` rather
/// than skipped.
///
/// Dropping such an entry instead would be unsound, not merely lossy: an
/// unannotated override (`class A(Base): def _one(self): ...`) removed from
/// `A`'s table lets the MRO walk fall through to `Base._one` and resolve the
/// call to the *base* class's return type -- wrong, not missed. Registering
/// the `Ty::Infer` signature keeps the override authoritative; the call then
/// yields `Ty::Infer`, and [`crate::empty_container`]'s own `concrete`
/// acceptance guard rejects any resolution containing one. That is what
