//! The constraint solver's half of #1476 (Part 3 of #1387): an
//! `isinstance(o, C)` guard narrows an `object`-bound name back to a native
//! type for the reads it dominates, mirroring `crate::narrow` in the check
//! phase.
//!
//! The solver runs first and its per-function verdict wins (D-220), so a
//! guarded `o + 1` it read as `object` would refuse a body the check phase
//! admits. The overlay is `ConstraintEnvironment::narrowed`, consulted by
//! the `Name` arm, and is set and dropped at the same points as the check
//! phase's:
//!
//! - the `if` arm narrows the branch the guard admits ([`branch_target`]);
//! - a negated guard whose body definitely terminates narrows the rest of
//!   the block ([`after_statement`]);
//! - any statement that rebinds the name ends the narrowing after it, and a
//!   loop that rebinds it anywhere ends it before it, because its body can
//!   run after its own rebinding ([`before_statement`], the check phase's
//!   `apply_kill_prescan`);
//! - a `try` body is walked in order, each handler starts without the
//!   names the body rebinds anywhere, and the `finally` without the names
//!   any path rebinds ([`kill_names`]), as the check phase's
//!   `check_try_stmt` and its path join do.
//!
//! The recognizer and the class gate are `pycc_hir`'s, shared with the
//! check phase and the MIR lowering; only the scope lookups are this
//! module's.
