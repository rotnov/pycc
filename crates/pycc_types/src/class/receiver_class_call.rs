//! Checking `type(self)(args)` (`HirExpr::ReceiverClassCall`, #1411).
//!
//! The call constructs the class `self` is statically typed as in the body
//! being checked, through the same [`super::resolve_instantiation`] an
//! explicit `C(args)` uses, so every constructor rule (the `__init__` MRO
//! walk, the argument check, the abstract/protocol/enum refusals) applies
//! unchanged. pycc dispatches statically (D-006), so that class *is* the
//! receiver's run-time class: an inherited body that constructs through its
//! receiver is compiled again for each subclass with `self` retyped
//! (D-254, `crate::inherited_copies`), and each compilation constructs its
//! own receiver's class, as CPython's `type(self)` does.
//!
//! Two shapes are refused here because lowering cannot see them: a body
//! where `self` is not bound to an instance of a class of this program (a
//! `@classmethod` or `@staticmethod`, or a `self` that is not the receiver),
//! and a program that rebinds the name `type`, where `type(self)` would
//! call that binding rather than the builtin.
