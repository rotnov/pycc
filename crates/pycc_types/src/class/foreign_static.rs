//! Type checking of a class attribute bound to
//! `staticmethod(<foreign callable>)` (Part 1 of #1284, D-256).
//!
//! The attribute has no static type of its own worth checking: once the
//! shared `pycc_hir` MRO helpers decide that a read or call reaches it, the
//! use site is rewritten to the recorded foreign reference chain
//! (`ForeignCallableRef::read_expr` / `call_expr`) and that expression is
//! checked in the **use-site** environment, exactly as `pycc_mir` lowers
//! it. Everything here is either that rewrite or one of the refusals that
//! keep the rewrite sound:
//!
//! - the root of the chain must still denote the foreign import where the
//!   rewrite lands ([`check_use_site`]);
//! - an instance receiver must be a plain name, since the rewrite discards
//!   it (#1346);
//! - an instance read whose positional winner is a method but that has a
//!   foreign entry later in the MRO is refused (rule 7, #1350);
//! - an instance receiver whose static class and some subclass disagree on
//!   the winner is refused, because pycc resolves the member statically
//!   (#1337, #1350);
//! - `super()` never takes the foreign path (#1346).
