//! Private-helper constraint solver: the type-inference seam that runs when
//! a module's function signatures cannot be read off their annotations.
//!
//! This submodule holds the whole constraint-solving seam, extracted from
//! [`lib.rs`](crate) per the repository's source-file decomposition rule
//! (AGENTS.md "Keep source files decomposable", [D-185]), following the
//! precedent set by [`monomorphize`](crate::monomorphize),
//! [`binop`](crate::binop), and [`class`](crate::class).
//!
//! The seam is cohesive because every item in it exists to serve one
//! pipeline, entered exactly once from the module-level driver
//! ([`crate::module`], issue #868): `check_and_resolve_all` calls
//! `checked_function_signatures_all` there, which either accepts the
//! fully-annotated fast path ([`concrete_function_signatures`]) or falls
//! through to [`infer_function_signatures_with_solver_all`], both in the
//! [`signatures`] submodule. Everything else here is one of that pipeline's
//! stages, and none of them has any other caller:
//!
//! * its own type vocabulary -- `TypeTerm`, `SignatureTerms`,
//!   `BinOpConstraint`, [`SolverConstraints`],
//!   [`AnnotationDefaultConstraint`], and [`ConstraintEnvironment`], none of
//!   which appear anywhere in the annotation-driven checker;
//! * the union-find over inference variables ([`fresh_variable`],
//!   [`fresh_term`], [`root`], [`resolved_term`], [`unify_terms`],
//!   [`merge_inferred_types`], [`term_for_type`]);
//! * constraint collection ([`collect_expr_constraints`],
//!   [`bind_comp_loop_var`], [`collect_block_constraints`]);
//! * constraint application ([`propagate_binop_constraints`],
//!   [`apply_annotation_defaults`]) and the signature materialization that
//!   validates a solved signature set against the ordinary checker
//!   ([`concrete_function_signatures`], [`infer_function_signatures_with_solver_all`],
//!   in [`signatures`]; `checked_function_signatures_all` itself moved to
//!   [`crate::module`] with the rest of the driver).
//!
//! Deliberately left in `lib.rs` (or, for the driver, `module.rs`): the
//! annotation-driven checker itself. `check_and_resolve`,
//! `infer_expr`/`infer_expr_in`, [`check_stmt`](crate::check_stmt),
//! `check_stmt_in_function`, `check_with_signatures_all`, `check_assignment`,
//! [`Environment`], and the `bind_local_types_*` helpers
//! stay behind, together with the four issue-#118 `*_in_place*` fast-path
//! wrappers around `check_stmt`/`check_stmt_in_function`, which the solver
//! never calls. The solver *calls* the checker (it validates every candidate
//! signature set by re-running it), but it is the crate's primary entry
//! surface and is used by every other seam in the crate -- moving it would be
//! a different extraction, not this one.
//!
//! Deliberately *not* merged into [`solver`]: that module
//! already exists and holds a narrower, differently-motivated scope -- the
//! solver's definite-assignment control-flow join helpers, extracted for
//! issue #359. Before this extraction, `lib.rs` reached it through eight
//! qualified `solver::` paths and deliberately had no `pub use solver::*;`.
//! Folding this seam into `solver` would force adding that glob, which would
//! re-export those pre-existing definite-assignment helpers at the crate root
//! as a side effect -- a change to code outside this seam. A new sibling
//! module keeps the extraction a pure relocation. All eight of those call
//! sites moved here with the rest of the seam, so `constraints` is now the
//! only caller of `solver`, reaching it through the same `solver::` paths.
//!

/// when it is.
///
/// # The subset invariant this seam and its callers owe the check phase
///
/// `crate::module::merge_solver_first` reports the solver's diagnostic for a
/// function whenever it has one, so the solver's *admitted* set must be a
/// subset of `crate::buffer::producer_assignment_ty`'s: admitting one
/// program that mirror refuses means recording an artifact-owned binding
/// whose later use raises the owned-buffer `C0001`, and that wrong message
/// displaces the check phase's correct one. Three consecutive review rounds
/// on this seam each found one missing member of the check phase's
/// admission conditions (`std_module_aliases`, `foreign_objects`, and the
/// length-type check below), so the conditions are enumerated here in full
/// and split across this predicate and its callers exactly as the check
/// phase splits them:
///
/// * here -- the call shape, the spelling, statement (h), the arity, and
///   the function-body scope;
/// * at each caller -- the parameter-rebinding guard
///   (`reject_buffer_parameter_rebinding`), the length type
///   (`reject_non_int_producer_length`), and, on the `AnnAssign` arm only,
///   the declared annotation (`reject_producer_annotation_mismatch`).
///
/// One condition of the check phase's is deliberately *not* mirrored, and
/// the difference is recorded rather than closed: an unresolved length term
/// (`def _h(n): a = ndarray(n)`, where the caller later fixes `n` to `str`)
/// is admitted here, because refusing it needs a length constraint carried
/// to the end of solving rather than one more guard at this seam. See
/// `reject_non_int_producer_length`'s own doc comment.
///
/// The solver's own statement (h): a `def` of the spelling is in
/// `signatures`, a `class` of it is in `shadowed_producers` (the solver has
/// no class table), a module-level value binding of it is in `bindings`, and
/// a *function-local* binding of it is in `local_names`. Any of the four
/// means the program's own meaning wins.
///
/// `local_names` cannot be folded into the `bindings` check and is not
/// redundant with it: `constraints::signatures` deliberately *removes* every
/// local name from the per-function `bindings` map it seeds, and a local is
/// re-entered there only once the walk reaches its binding statement. A body
/// that binds the spelling after using it therefore has an empty `bindings`
/// answer at the use site, while CPython makes the name local for the whole
/// body and raises `UnboundLocalError`. The check-phase mirror is
/// `crate::buffer::producer_assignment_ty`; declining here hands the value to
/// the ordinary `Call` walk, whose own `is_local` gate (further down this
/// file, ahead of the producer refusal) reports `unbound_local`.
///
/// `std_module_aliases` is the mirror of that same check's fifth arm: a
/// stdlib module alias (`import math as ndarray`) binds the spelling but is
/// recorded in no other table, so without it this solver -- which runs over
/// unannotated private helpers -- allocated a buffer for a program whose own
/// binding makes the call CPython's `TypeError`. See
/// `crate::buffer::producer_assignment_ty` for the full reason, and
/// `docs/TYPE_SYSTEM.md`'s `memoryview` row for the canonical enumeration.
///
/// `foreign_objects` is the sixth arm, and it is one the check-phase mirror
/// does not need: `crate::foreign::bind_foreign_objects_at` binds a foreign
/// `import ndarray` into the check phase's own `bindings` as `Ty::Object`,
/// so that mirror's `bindings` arm already declines, while the solver
/// deliberately keeps foreign names *out* of `bindings` and records them in
/// this separate table instead (see the `Name` arm for why). Without this
/// arm the solver treats the foreign call as the intrinsic producer and
/// marks the assigned name artifact-owned, so a second use of it raises the
/// owned-buffer `C0001` -- and `crate::module`'s `merge_solver_first` makes
/// that the reported diagnostic, displacing the `I0404` foreign refusal the
/// check phase correctly produces and pointing the span at the `import`
/// line. The program is refused either way; only the message is wrong. See
/// `docs/TYPE_SYSTEM.md`'s `memoryview` row for the canonical enumeration.
