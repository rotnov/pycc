//! Expression type inference: [`infer_expr`] and its `local_names`-aware
//! worker `infer_expr_in`.
//!
//! This is the crate's single largest cohesion boundary -- one recursive
//! walk over every [`HirExpr`] variant, producing the expression's [`Ty`]
//! or the diagnostic that rejects it. It was extracted from
//! [`lib.rs`](crate) per the repository's source-file decomposition rule
//! (AGENTS.md "Keep source files decomposable", tracked by issue #544),
//! as a pure relocation: no inference behavior changed with the move.
//!
//! Statement checking, assignability, and the class/exception/operator
//! helpers this walk calls into all stay where they were -- in
//! [`lib.rs`](crate) and its other submodules -- so this module is the
//! expression seam only.

///   `None` for a `BindingState::Maybe` binding, so a conditionally bound
///   `m` (`if c: m = 1.0`) would otherwise slip past the check and reach
///   the libm path.
/// - `def_rebound` (the precedent is the `non_callable_binding` gate in
///   `infer_expr_in`'s call arm), never `lookup_function`, which is
///   position-blind: `import math` / `print(math.sqrt(4.0))` / `def
///   math(): ...` *below* the use is valid CPython and must stay accepted,
///   which only the source-order rebinding set encodes. Inside a function
///   body the set is the module's final one (`child_for_function` clones
///   it after pass 2), so there a `def m()` anywhere in the module
///   rejects `m.sqrt` -- a fail-closed divergence recorded in the #962
///   ADR.

///
/// - `Ok(true)`: `name` is a registered class and nothing shadows it, so the

/// - `Ok(false)`: `name` is not a class at all, or a *parameter or

/// - `Err(C0001)`: `name` is a class whose own name the **module's top-level
///   code** also binds to a value, and the read is inside a function body.
