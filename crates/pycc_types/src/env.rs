//! The type checker's scope model: [`BindingState`] and [`Environment`].
//!
//! Every pass in this crate threads an [`Environment`] -- the flat,
//! name-keyed table of value bindings, declared annotations, function
//! signatures, generic definitions, and class definitions that one scope
//! can see -- and reads a name's [`BindingState`] to distinguish a name
//! that is *definitely* assigned from one that is only *maybe* assigned
//! on some path (the T0021/T0041 distinction).
//!
//! It was extracted from [`lib.rs`](crate) per the repository's
//! source-file decomposition rule (AGENTS.md "Keep source files
//! decomposable", tracked by issue #544), as a pure relocation: no
//! scope-model behavior changed with the move. The passes that *use* an
//! environment -- expression inference, statement checking, function
//! checking, the constraint solver -- all stay where they were, so this
//! module is the environment seam only.
