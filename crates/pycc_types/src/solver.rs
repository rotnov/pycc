//! Private-helper constraint solver: definite-assignment join helpers.
//!
//! Issue #359 (Part 2 of #118) extends the validation pass's
//! definite-assignment tracking (T0041, D-147) to the private-helper
//! constraint solver. This submodule holds the solver's control-flow join
//! helpers, extracted from [`lib.rs`] per the repository's source-file
//! decomposition rule (AGENTS.md "Keep source files decomposable"). The
//! [`ConstraintEnvironment`] struct and the [`collect_block_constraints`](crate::constraints::collect_block_constraints)
//! arms that call these helpers live in [`constraints`](crate::constraints)
//! because they are deeply intertwined with the rest of the type-inference solver
//! (`collect_expr_constraints`, `unify_terms`, `fresh_term`, etc.).

/// Issue #359 (Part 2 of #118): joins two if-branch environments back
/// into `env` after cloning and running each branch independently.
/// Mirrors the validation pass's `join_if_branches` (D-147) but works
/// with the solver's `TypeTerm`-based `ConstraintEnvironment.bindings`
/// and tracks maybe-bound names in `maybe_bindings` instead of wrapping
/// each binding in a `BindingState` variant.
///
/// `pre_existing` is the set of binding names that were in `env.bindings`
/// before the `if` — names introduced by only one branch are maybe-bound,
/// names introduced by both branches are definitely bound.
/// Part 2a of #1142 (#1165), round-11 review finding 2: carry a branch's
/// buffer-provenance *invalidation* back out of the branch.
///
/// Provenance joins as a union, which can only ever add names. A branch that
/// rebinds an artifact-owned name -- `else: a = 1`, `except ... as a`,
/// `case a:`, a loop body's `a = 1` -- therefore had its invalidation
/// silently undone, either by the ancestor's own surviving marker or by the
/// *other* branch's marker for a name both branches introduce. The stale
/// `Ok(Ty::MemoryView)` binding was merged back with it, so a later read
/// raised the owned-buffer `C0001` and displaced the check phase's `T0023`
/// for the reassignment.
///
/// A name is contested when some joined branch has a binding or an opaque
/// marker for it and does *not* own it: that branch reached the join with
/// the name denoting something else. Contested names are invalidated,
/// which is the conservative reading -- the solver stops answering for a
/// name whose provenance depends on the path, and the check phase's own
/// diagnostic stands.
///
/// Written as "has a binding and does not own it" rather than as an
/// intersection of the owned sets, because an intersection would also drop
/// a name only *one* branch introduces (`if c: a = ndarray(4)` followed by
/// `a[0]`), which is the union's own keep path and must survive. Run after
/// the binding merge, since the merge is what re-imports the stale term.

    // when only ONE branch reassigns it to a real term -- otherwise a
    // branch's term would get written into `env.bindings` unconditionally
    // (unlike a pre-existing *real* binding, which already blocks the
    // insert because `env.bindings` already holds an entry for it), even
    // though the other (untouched) branch's actual value is still the old
    // opaque one; since such a name is not newly introduced by either
    // branch, it would not land in `maybe_bindings` below either, so the
    // unguarded insert would make `HirExpr::Name`'s lookup return that one
    // branch's term as if it always applied on every path -- a genuine
    // unmasking, not just an imprecision.

    // Issue #771 join-site follow-up, THIRD reviewer pass: the naive form of
    // this guard (skip whenever `pre_existing.contains(name) &&
    // !env.bindings.contains_key(name)`, independent of what the *other*
    // branch did) is too broad -- it also fires when BOTH branches reassign
    // the same pre-existing-opaque name to a real term (e.g. `y = d.get(...)`
    // then `if cond: y = 1 else: y = 2`), skipping both branches' real terms
    // in that case too. Because `env.opaque_bindings` already carries the
    // name from before the `if` and the opaque-merge loop below only ever
    // inserts (never removes), the outcome is not an `unbound_local`
    // misdiagnosis -- `HirExpr::Name` still resolves the name via the
    // surviving stale opaque marker. The bug is a silent masking: both
    // branches' concrete terms get dropped and the name is reported as
    // "opaque, no term available" even though every path through the `if`
    // actually assigned it a real, solver-representable type -- for a name
    // that is not branch-conditional at all. The guard therefore only skips
    // when the *other* branch's environment does
    // not also carry a real term for the same name: that is precisely the
    // "reassigned in exactly one branch" case the comment above describes.
    // When both branches independently reassign a pre-existing-opaque name,
    // this guard does not fire in either loop, so the merge proceeds via the
    // ordinary first-body-then-orelse `entry().or_insert()` below --
    // identical first-wins semantics to a name that is genuinely new to both
