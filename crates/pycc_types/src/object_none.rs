//! `None` into an `object` return slot (#1387, D-258's return-position
//! amendment).
//!
//! D-258 makes `object` (and, in an `--ext` module, `Any`) the opaque
//! CPython top type, and `None` is a CPython object -- but `None` stays a
//! native `Ty::None` value inside a compiled body, and `crate::is_assignable`
//! deliberately keeps it out of every `object` slot.
//!
//! The return position was the first seam to narrow that, for the two
//! spellings whose value is CPython's `None` by construction: a bare
//! `return` and `return None` (the literal). Since Part 2 of #1387 every
//! `None`-typed *value* -- the literal, or a call such as `return g()` with
//! `g -> None` -- is boxed into an `object` slot at every seam
//! (`crate::object_box`), so what this module still owns is the bare
//! `return`, which has no value for that rule to see. Falling off the end of
//! an `object` function stays `T0022` -- an implicit `None` is not written
//! down anywhere and `crate::return_coverage` keeps its existing contract.
//!
//! Both walkers -- `crate::check_stmt_in_function` and the solver's
//! `HirStmt::Return` arm -- call [`admits_none_return`], so the two can
//! never disagree about the admitted set. Codegen's counterpart is
//! `pycc_codegen`'s `object_return` module.
