//! Foreign (CPython-object) import bindings in the type environment
//! (Part 1 of #1026, PR 1c of #1080).
//!
//! `import numpy` binds `numpy` to [`Ty::Object`], an opaque `PyObject *`
//! whose shape pycc knows nothing about. Since #1278 an unaliased
//! top-level `from itertools import product, chain` binds each imported
//! name the same way -- `product` is the CPython object
//! `itertools.product`, typed [`Ty::Object`] like any other foreign
//! binding, so every refusal below applies to it unchanged. Every refusal of an operation on
//! such a value is `I0404`.
//!
//! **Part 2 of #1026 (#1081) moved the refusal from the producer to the
//! consumers, and this paragraph replaces the containment invariant Part 1
//! rested on.** Part 1 refused the *read* of a foreign binding, which
//! refused every derived operation at once without a refusal per
//! operation. That works only while no operation is supported. Part 2
//! supports `numpy.pi`, and `infer_expr_in` is context-free -- it cannot
//! see whether the read it is answering feeds an attribute load or a
//! `print` -- so a conditional relaxation of the read is not expressible.
//! The read is therefore admitted *in a module body* and each **consuming**
//! site refuses on its own.
//!
//! Two consequences follow, and both are load-bearing:
//!
//! 1. A `Ty::Object` value no longer has a name. The diagnostic builder
//!    below names the **operation** instead ([`object_operation_unsupported`]),
//!    because the consumer knows what it was about to do while the value
//!    it holds is an anonymous temporary.
//! 2. There are now several producer shapes, not one: `o.attr`
//!    (`HirExpr::AttrGet` over a `Ty::Object` base), a call to an
//!    unannotated private helper whose inferred return is `Ty::Object`
//!    (`constraints.rs`'s `AttrGet` term), `o.method(...)` (PR 2b of
//!    #1081), `o[k]` (PR 3b of #1082), and the loop variable of
//!    `for x in <object>:` (`HirStmt::ForObject`, PR 3c of #1082, which
//!    binds `x` to `Ty::Object` directly rather than through
//!    `check_assignment`). Every refusal must
//!    therefore key on the **type**, never on the producing expression
//!    shape, and the list is expected to keep growing.
//!
//! **PR 2a of #1081 bounded the admitted read by position; #1316 widened
//! the bound to function bodies.** A foreign object may be read only where
//! the compiler can report a failed lookup and a read before the `import`:
//!
//! * a module body, where a read placed *above* the `import` is an
//!   ordinary unbound-name `T0021` -- see [`bind_foreign_objects_at`] --
//!   and a failed operation stops the module exec;
//! * a function body, method body or unannotated helper, for any
//!   definitely-bound `Ty::Object` name: a module-level foreign import
//!   (#1316), a module-level name a `x = <object>` statement bound (#1325),
//!   a function local, or an unannotated helper's solver-inferred `object`
//!   parameter (Part 1 of #1333). D-041 checks a body against the module
//!   environment as it stands after all top-level code, so it cannot see
//!   whether the call site precedes the module-level binding;
//!   `pycc_codegen` answers that read at run time with the `NameError`
//!   CPython raises, and bridges a failed operation into pycc's pending
//!   exception so the body's own `try` can catch it (`pycc_codegen`'s
//!   `foreign_fail.rs`).
//!
//! **Part 1 of #1333 admitted holding an object beyond one expression in a
//! function body**: binding it to a local (`check_assignment`), returning
//! it, and passing it to an ordinary pycc-compiled function. No reference
//! is released on scope exit -- the #1092 leak-only rule extends to function
//! locals unchanged (`docs/RUNTIME.md`). Passing one to a *generic* function
//! stays refused ([`reject_object_arguments`]), and so does a `for` over an
//! object inside a function body (Part 2 of #1333, #1363). An unannotated
//! helper's parameter used as a method-call base or a callee is still a
//! solver variable when its body is walked, so it reports `T0021` (Part 3 of
//! #1333, #1364).
//!
//! **#1325 admitted binding an object to a name in a module body.** At
//! module scope `x = product("ab")` stores the new reference into an
//! ordinary module global that never releases it (a rebinding leaks the old
//! reference, #1092); Part 1 of #1333 removed `check_assignment`'s
//! remaining function-body refusal. `for t in x:` over such a name is the bare-name form
//! of `HirStmt::ForObject`: `check_stmt`'s `ForList` arm routes a
//! definitely-bound `object` name to the same checks ([`for_loop`]).
//!
//! `docs/TYPE_SYSTEM.md` carries the user-facing statement of both.
//!
//! **PR 2b of #1081 added the second supported operation: a method call.**
//! `expr::infer_expr_in`'s `HirExpr::MethodCall` arm now answers
//! [`Ty::Object`] for a `Ty::Object` base, where it previously fell through
//! to `class::resolve_method_call`'s "not a class instance" `T0043`. The
//! branch admits only *positional* arguments (`HirExpr::MethodCall` carries
//! no keyword arguments at all) whose types are `int`, `float`, `bool` or
//! `str` -- the four scalars the shim has a `pycc_ext_obj_pack_*` helper
//! for -- and refuses every other argument type with
//! [`object_operation_unsupported`]; Part 2a of #1371 widened the admitted
//! set with a second `Ty::Object` (packed by `pycc_ext_obj_pack_object`). The
//! call inherits the positional bound unchanged: the base is read through
//! the same `HirExpr::Name` arm.
//!
//! Four method names reach this arm through a second node. `pycc_hir`'s
//! container fast paths claim `append`, `pop`, `get` and `add` while
//! lowering, from their spelling alone. Issue #1095: in a module that can
//! hold a CPython object -- an `ext` module (D-258) or one that has bound a
//! foreign import (D-244 rule 3) -- such a call is a
//! `HirExpr::ReceiverDispatchedCall` keeping both readings (the node #1188
//! introduced for user classes), and `pycc_hir::receiver_takes_method_path`
//! sends a `Ty::Object` receiver to the method reading, which is this arm.
//! So `gc.get(1, 2)`, `gc.get(1)` and `value_stack.append(x)` are the
//! foreign method call whatever their arity, while a native `list`, `dict`
//! or `set` receiver keeps the container reading and its diagnostics.
//! `docs/TYPE_SYSTEM.md`'s `object` row owns that statement.
//!
//! **PR 3a of #1082 (Part 3 of #1026) added `len` and truth testing, and
//! deleted a whole class of refusal.** `len(o)` type-checks to `Ty::Int`
//! (`expr.rs`'s and `constraints.rs`'s `len` guards both admit
//! [`Ty::Object`] now), and an `if`/`while` test or a comprehension guard
//! places no constraint on its operand at all -- `pycc_codegen`'s `truthy`
//! grew a `Scalar::Object` arm that calls the shim's `pycc_ext_obj_truthy`,
//! so the ten `reject_object_condition` sites that existed only to keep an
//! object away from a codegen panic are gone. Nothing else about the
//! positional bound changes: both operations read their operand through the
//! same `HirExpr::Name` arm.
//!
//! `not o` is *not* part of this: `unop.rs`'s `Not` arm answers `T0021` for
//! a non-`bool` operand, which it did before PR 3a and still does.
//!
//! **PR 3b of #1082 added another producer shape: a subscript load.**
//! `o[k]` type-checks to [`Ty::Object`] (`expr.rs`'s `HirExpr::Subscript`
//! arm has a `Ty::Object` base arm ahead of the `T0033` catch-all, and
//! `constraints.rs`'s own `Subscript` arm lifts the term exactly as its
//! `AttrGet` arm does), so a key is now a fourth place a foreign value can
//! be consumed. The admitted keys are the same four scalars a method call's
//! arguments are -- `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, the ones with a
//! `pycc_ext_obj_pack_*` helper -- and every other key type is refused with
//! [`object_operation_unsupported`] naming the key's type. Part 2a of #1371
//! widened the admitted keys with a second [`Ty::Object`].
//!
//! Only the **load** is admitted. `o[k] = v` stays refused: it is a
//! different HIR shape, which `pycc_hir` rejects with `C0001` ("only
//! assigning to a bare-name subscript target") before this crate sees it.
//! `x = o[k]` is admitted in a module body since #1325 and in a function
//! body since Part 1 of #1333. A *slice* (`o[a:b]`) is a third shape
//! again, admitted as a load since Part 2b of #1371 by [`slice`]; every
//! non-object base keeps `expr.rs`'s `HirExpr::Slice` `T0033`. The
//! positional bound is inherited unchanged.
//!
//! **PR 4a of #1083 (Part 4 of #1026) added two conversions *out* of the
//! opaque type: `float(o)` and `bool(o)`.** Both are handled in `expr.rs`'s
//! `HirExpr::Call` arm (and mirrored in `constraints.rs`) rather than here:
//! `float`'s existing argument gate gains [`Ty::Object`], and `bool` gets a
//! new arm admitted for [`Ty::Object`] **only**, so `bool(1)` keeps its
//! `C0001` verbatim. Both arms carry `float`'s user-defined-function guard,
//! because a `def float(...)`/`def bool(...)` is a valid working program
//! today and must keep winning.
//!
//! These are the first operations that produce a *pycc-native* value from an
//! object, so they are also the first that leave nothing behind: the shim
//! releases its own CPython temporary on every exit and no new reference
//! escapes, which is why Part 4 does not grow #1092. They run CPython's own
//! conversion protocol (`PyNumber_Float`, `PyObject_IsTrue`), which is *not*
//! a D-244 rule-7 violation: rule 7 closes the boundary at the thunk export
//! seam, where a value crosses implicitly and the annotation is the whole
//! contract, whereas `float(o)` in user source is an explicit conversion
//! request that names its destination type. `docs/TYPE_SYSTEM.md`'s `object`
//! row carries the user-facing statement.
//!
//! The residual incoherence is stated rather than hidden: `bool(o)` compiles
//! while `bool(1)` is still `C0001`, because Part 4 relaxes exactly the
//! object case and leaves the general builtin-conversion story to
//! #1017/#1018. The positional bound is inherited unchanged. (Part 4 left
//! `print(o)` itself `I0404` while `print(float(o))` type-checked; #1340
//! admits `print(o)` and `f"{o}"` too -- see below.)
//!
//! **PR 4b of #1083 adds the other two conversions out of the opaque type:
//! `int(o)` and `str(o)`.** Both are new `expr.rs` arms (mirrored in
//! `constraints.rs`) on the `bool` arm's exact shape -- [`Ty::Object`]
//! **only**, both the user-defined-function and the user-defined-class guard
//! on the whole arm, since neither arm admits anything else. `int(o)` runs
//! `PyNumber_Long` and D-141-encodes the result, refusing a value outside the
//! inline-integer range `[-2**62, 2**62-1]` with `OverflowError` (#1040, no
//! bigint path); `str(o)` runs `PyObject_Str` and copies the UTF-8 out with
//! `pycc_rt_str_from_literal`, producing exactly what a `str` literal
//! produces. Both release their CPython temporary on every exit, so Part 4
//! still adds nothing to #1092.
//!
//! The same asymmetry is inherited and stated: `str(o)` compiles while
//! `str(1)` keeps its `C0001`.
//!
//! **#1340 admits rendering the object itself: `print(o)` and `f"{o}"`.**
//! `string_conversion.rs`'s `Ty::Object` refusal is gone, and
//! `pycc_codegen` renders the operand through the shim as CPython does --
//! `print` calls `str()` (`pycc_ext_obj_to_str`) in its write phase, after
//! every argument is evaluated, and an f-string part calls
//! `format(o, '')` (`pycc_ext_obj_format`, the operand's `__format__`) as
//! soon as it is evaluated. Conversion flags and format specs (`f"{o!r}"`,
//! `f"{o:>8}"`) stay refused in `pycc_hir` for every operand type.
//!
//! **PR 4c of #1083 admits the opaque type at one *annotated assignment*.**
//! `x: tuple[float, float, float] = <object>` in a module body -- and more
//! generally any fixed-arity annotation whose every element is `float` --
//! now compiles. This is the first Part 4 operation that is not a call:
//! `check_stmt`'s module-level `HirStmt::AnnAssign` arm tests
//! [`is_object_float_tuple_annotation`] *ahead of* `is_assignable_env`, so
//! the relaxation is a branch in that one arm rather than a widening of
//! `is_assignable`, which would have admitted the pair everywhere a value
//! flows into a declared type.
//!
//! **Strict container, converting elements.** The shim checks
//! `PyTuple_Check` with an exact-arity test and then runs `PyNumber_Float`
//! on each item; the runtime object's items are never type-checked by pycc,
//! and a bad item fails at run time with whatever CPython raises. The two
//! halves answer two different questions -- D-115/D-116 leave no shape for
//! a differently-sized sequence, while `float` is a type the author wrote,
//! which makes converting to it the same explicit-conversion case PR 4a
//! records.
//!
//! Everything else stays refused, and the refusals are two different
//! diagnostics: a *mixed* annotation such as `tuple[float, int]` is the
//! ordinary `T0025` this arm already produced, while PEP 585's variadic
//! `tuple[float, ...]` never reaches this crate -- `pycc_hir` refuses the
//! `...` type argument with `T0053` while lowering the annotation. The
//! in-function arm gains no branch at all: since #1316 the read of a
//! module-level foreign name is admitted there, and the ordinary
//! assignability check refuses the `object` value against the declared
//! tuple with `T0025`, as PR 4c's own test pins.
//!
//! **#1313 added a direct call of an `object`-typed name** (`product("ab")`
//! after `from itertools import product`, or a call of a `for` loop target
//! bound to an object). `expr::infer_expr_in`'s
//! `HirExpr::Call` arm answers [`Ty::Object`] for a callee bound to
//! [`Ty::Object`] in a module body -- and, since #1316 and Part 1 of #1333,
//! in a function body too -- under the
//! same positional-scalar
//! argument rule as a method call ([`check_object_call_args`]); the
//! constraint solver's own `Call` arm answers the same term. Part 2 kept
//! the call refused because admitting `f(2.0)` also admits `numpy(1)`,
//! which CPython answers with `TypeError: 'module' object is not
//! callable`. That is now the intended reading: the call is compiled and
//! the host raises exactly that `TypeError`, on the same failure edge
//! every other object operation uses: uncatchable in a module body
//! (#1096), catchable in a function body (#1316).
//!
//! [`reject_object_read`] serves the one site that keys on a *named*
//! binding rather than on a consumed value: `lookup_bound_name` (D-105's
//! `ForList`/`ListAppend` HIR shape carries its list as a plain `String`, so
//! it never becomes a `HirExpr::Name`). Part 1 of #1333 removed the other
//! two -- the in-function read and the in-function call of an `object`
//! value -- because both are admitted now.
