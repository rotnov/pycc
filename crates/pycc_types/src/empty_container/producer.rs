/// The first producer use of `target` anywhere in `body`, in source order.
///
/// Scanning the whole function body from its start -- rather than only
/// forward from the assignment being resolved -- is what implements the
/// **first-wins-within-a-scope** rule for a name assigned `[]` in more than
/// one branch: `if c: xs = []; xs.append(1)` / `else: xs = [];
/// xs.append("a")` resolves *both* nodes from the first producer, and the
/// second branch's `append` then fails with the ordinary element-type
/// mismatch. A name-keyed resolution cannot represent two different types
/// for one binding, and neither can the binding itself.
///
/// A producer is recognized only in **statement position** -- a bare
/// `xs.append(v)` or `d[k] = v`. `HirExpr::ListAppend` is also a valid value
/// expression (`y = xs.append(v)` binds `None`), and such an occurrence is
/// *not* a producer here, so `xs = []` followed only by `y = xs.append(1)`
/// reports `T0003`. That restriction is deliberate and matches the rewrite
/// side: `rewrite_body` and `body_has_empty_literal` likewise visit direct
/// assignment values and block bodies, never nested *expression* positions, so
/// the whole pass has one statable shape. The boundary is between statement
/// and expression nesting, not between one block form and another: every block
/// form is walked, via the shared [`nested_bodies`] inventory. See D-245
/// item 8.
///
/// The scan returns the first *syntactic* producer occurrence for the name,
/// not the first shape-compatible one: a `ListAppend` on a name later used as
/// a dict ends the scan with a `Resolution::List`. `Resolution::matches`
/// discards a resolution of the wrong shape at the rewrite site, so a
/// cross-shape hit costs a missed resolution (`T0003`) and never yields a
/// wrong element type. Such a program fails type-checking on its own terms
/// anyway. The same is true of a producer whose value does not infer: the
/// scan ends there with a miss rather than continuing to a later producer,
/// because a later producer's element type is not the one the program's
/// first use asks for, and selecting it would be a wrong resolution rather
/// than a missed one. See [`ProducerScan`].
