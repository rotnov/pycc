//! #1289: definite assignment across a `try` statement.
//!
//! A name bound by the body and by every handler that can complete the
//! statement is definitely bound after it. The conformance fixture
//! `tests/fixtures/try_except_definite_assign.py` pins the programs that now
//! run; these tests pin the arms that fixture cannot reach, or reaches only
//! indirectly: the zero-fall-through fallback, which paths count, the `as`
//! name's unbinding, the `finally` entry state, the type walk's direction,
//! and the constraint solver's mirror of each (`promote_try_fallthrough`).
