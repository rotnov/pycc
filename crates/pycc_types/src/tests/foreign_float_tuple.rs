//! Part 4 of #1026 (PR 4c of #1083): the one annotated assignment that
//! admits a CPython object.
//!
//! `x: tuple[float, float, float] = <object>` in a module body compiles,
//! and so does any fixed-arity annotation whose every element is `float`.
//! `foreign::is_object_float_tuple_annotation` owns the rule; these tests
//! pin it from the outside, in both directions, on the one arm that
//! consults it.
//!
//! **Why the relaxation is a branch and not a widening.** It sits in
//! `check_stmt`'s module-level `HirStmt::AnnAssign` arm, ahead of
//! `is_assignable_env`. `is_assignable` is consulted wherever a value flows
//! into a declared type -- a parameter, a `return`, a class attribute -- so
//! widening it would have admitted the pair at every one of those too,
//! which is not what Part 4 supports. The negative tests below are the
//! statement of that: the same pair at any other position stays refused.
