//! Issue #769 (Part 2 of #747): flow-sensitive `Optional[T]` narrowing.
//!
//! Extracted into its own module per the repository's source-file
//! decomposition rule (AGENTS.md "Keep source files decomposable") rather
//! than growing `lib.rs`'s `HirStmt::If` arms in place.
//!
//! ## Design: an overlay, not a join-time mutation
//!
//! `join_if_branches` (`lib.rs`) implements first-assignment-wins joining
//! of two branch-local `Environment` clones' `bindings` back into the
//! parent `env`. If narrowing mutated a branch clone's own `bindings` entry
//! for the narrowed name (e.g. rebinding `x` to `Ty::Int` inside an `if x
//! is not None:` body), the join would either leak that narrowed type past
//! the `if` (since `join_if_branches` is oblivious to *why* a binding
//! changed) or spuriously reject the join on a mismatch with the other
//! branch's still-`Optional` binding, depending on `is_assignable`'s
//! direction. Neither is correct: outside the `if`, `x` must still be
//! `Optional[int]`.
//!
//! Instead, narrowing lives entirely in a side table,
//! [`crate::env::Environment::narrowed`], populated only on branch-local
//! `env` clones (in-branch narrowing, [`narrowing_target`] /
//! [`apply_branch_narrowing`]) or directly on the real `env` for the
//! early-return continuation shape ([`apply_post_if_narrowing`]). This
//! table is *never* merged into `bindings` and `join_if_branches` never
//! reads it, so it cannot structurally leak across the join -- there is no
//! join step for it to leak through. `crate::expr::infer_expr_in`'s
//! `HirExpr::Name` arm is the only place a *read* of a name consults the
//! overlay; `check_assignment`'s target-checking path never does (it
//! checks a `name = value` assignment against `name`'s real, un-narrowed
//! type, and separately clears the overlay entry for that name -- killing
//! the narrowing the moment the name is reassigned).
//!
//! ## `definitely_terminates`: a strict predicate, not `contains_return`
//!
//! `constraints.rs::contains_return` answers "does a `return` occur
//! *anywhere* in this body, including nested inside an unrelated inner
//! `if`?" -- true for `if flag: return 0` even when `flag` is false on some
//! paths. That is unsound as a narrowing-eligibility guard: naively using
//! it for
//!
//! ```python
//! if x is None:
//!     if flag:
//!         return 0
//! print(x + 1)
//! ```
//!
//! would incorrectly narrow `x` after the outer `if` even though `x` can
//! still be `None` when `flag` is `False` (the outer `if`'s body does not
//! terminate on every path). [`pycc_hir::definitely_terminates`] is a new, strictly
//! narrower predicate: true only when the body's *last* statement is
//! itself unconditionally terminating -- a bare `return`, or an `if` whose
//! `body` **and** non-empty `orelse` both recursively terminate. `raise` is
//! deliberately *not* a terminator here (a documented scope cut -- see its
//! own doc comment), and `match` is not analyzed at all (also a documented
//! scope cut, kept simple and sound by omission rather than by an
//! exhaustiveness heuristic that could be wrong).
//!
//! ## Deliberate scope cuts (recorded in D-205)
//!
//! - Only a *top-level* `if name is None:` / `if name is not None:` test is
//!   recognized -- no narrowing through a compound `and`/`or` test.
//! - `raise` in a branch does not count as a terminator for the
//!   early-return continuation shape; only `return` (directly, or via an
//!   exhaustive nested `if`) does.
//! - Since #1476 (Part 3 of #1387) a second recognizer,
//!   `pycc_hir::isinstance_test`, narrows an `object` name to a native type
//!   under `isinstance(name, C)` (the body) or `not isinstance(name, C)`
//!   (the `orelse`, and the continuation after a body that definitely
//!   terminates). The same scope cuts apply: no `and`/`or`, no tuple of
//!   classes.
//! - No narrowing-to-`None` shape: `if name is not None: ... else: <use
//!   name as None>` is not implemented (there is no `Ty::None`-typed
//!   *narrowing* target in this design -- `Ty::None` already exists as a
//!   type but is not what a "narrowed" name would become here), and the
//!   post-`if` early-return continuation shape only ever narrows to the
//!   Optional's inner type, never to `Ty::None`.

///
/// A single left-to-right source-order pass (what every other narrowing
/// entry point in this module and `lib.rs` still does) is unsound
/// whenever the body it checks can be *entered or re-entered* such that a
/// read earlier in source order than a kill can nonetheless execute
/// *after* that kill at runtime:
///
/// - A `while`/`for` loop body checked/lowered once but executed
///   repeatedly: a read on line 2 followed by a kill on line 3 is fine on
///   the first iteration, but the second iteration's read on line 2 runs
///   after the first iteration's kill on line 3 already fired.
/// - An `except` handler, entered partway through the `try` body it
///   guards: a handler read is checked against the *pre-try* narrowing
///   state, but at runtime the handler only ever runs after some prefix
///   of the try body already executed -- a kill anywhere in that body may
///   have already invalidated the narrowing before the handler starts.
///
/// The prescan is deliberately whole-body and non-fixpoint: it does not
/// attempt to determine *which* reads are actually reachable after a
/// given kill (that would need a real control-flow reachability analysis
/// per read), it just drops the narrowing for the entire body once, unconditionally,
/// whenever the body contains any kill of that name at all. This is sound
/// (it can only under-narrow, never over-narrow) and requires no fixpoint
/// iteration, at the cost of also dropping narrowing for a read that
/// (looking only at that one execution) precedes every kill -- a loop
/// body that reads a narrowed name but never kills it anywhere is
/// unaffected (its kill set is empty), so this conservative rule only
/// costs precision on bodies that actually do kill the name somewhere.
///
/// Call this before checking/lowering a loop body (`While`/`ForRange`/
/// `ForList`, both module and function scope, every fast- and slow-path

/// (`exception::try_join`'s `apply_finally_kill_prescan`). A straight-line
