/// checks its `finally` block. Shared by [`check_try_stmt`] and

/// not.
///
/// Two separate questions are answered over two separate sets of
/// environments.
///
/// **Type consistency, over every environment.** The body, then each
/// handler in source order, then `else` are walked, and every name that is
/// not bound before the `try` must keep one representation across all of
/// them: a later type must be assignable to the first-established one, in
/// `check_assignment`'s direction. `Maybe` bindings and terminating handlers
/// count, because every path stores into the same slot. The first-established
/// type becomes the name's type after the statement.
///
/// A name that any handler of the statement binds with `as` is left out of
/// this walk entirely, on every path, and out of the definiteness join below:
/// its type and its definiteness after the statement are exactly the
/// pre-#1289 conservative join's. On that join `try: e = 10 // d / except
/// ZeroDivisionError as e: ...` is accepted, a later `e = 5` is `T0023`
/// against the exception type, and a later read is `T0041`.
///
/// `join_if_branches` is deliberately not used to fold the paths: it checks
/// `is_assignable(first, later)`, the reverse direction, and keeps the first
/// path's type. For that reason `if d == 0: x = True / else: x = 1 /
/// print(x)` prints `True True` where CPython prints `True 1` (an `if`/`else`
/// defect outside #1289's scope); a `try` fold through it would also refuse
/// a valid `try: x = 10 // d / except ZeroDivisionError: x = False`.
///
/// **Definiteness, over the paths that fall through the statement only.**
/// Those are the `else` path (when neither the body nor `else` always
/// terminates) and every handler whose body does not always terminate. A
/// name is `Definitely` bound after the statement when it is `Definitely`
/// bound on every such path. A handler's `as` name is never promoted this
/// way and keeps its conservative state: CPython unbinds it on that
/// handler's exit with an implicit `del`, and even when that handler always
/// terminates, codegen gives the name one slot typed for the exception
/// instance, which a later read of the body's `int` cannot share. So `try: e = 10 // d / except ZeroDivisionError as e: raise /
/// return e` is `T0041` although CPython runs it: a documented limitation
/// that refuses rather than miscompiles.
///
/// The pre-#1289 conservative join (the body joined like a loop body, then every
/// handler and `else` like `if` branches) is still computed, with the
/// first-established types written over its own for every name that is not
/// an `as` name. It supplies the name set
/// and buffer provenance, and is the entry state of `finally`, which can be
/// entered after any partial run. When no path falls through, it is also the
/// state after the statement. Otherwise `finally` is checked a second time
/// against the fall-through join to compute that state; checking twice has
/// no side effect beyond the environment it mutates.
///
/// The `else` fold now propagates `join_if_branches`'s error instead of
/// discarding it, like the handler folds always did. No test reaches that
/// error: it fires only for a name `Definitely` bound on both sides with
/// incompatible types, and after the loop-style body join every name new to
/// the statement is `Maybe` while a pre-existing name keeps its pinned type
/// on every path. The type walk above is what refuses a handler/`else`
/// mismatch (`tests/diagnostics/t0023_try_handler_else_mismatch.py`).
