//! The type checker's reading of a [`HirExpr::ReceiverDispatchedCall`]
//! (issue #1188).
//!
//! HIR lowering keeps both readings of `recv.<append|pop|get|add>(...)` in a
//! module that can see a user class defining that method name. This module
//! picks one, in the order `docs/TYPE_SYSTEM.md` states:
//!
//! 1. a receiver that names a class with a static or class method of that
//!    name takes the method reading, exactly as the `MethodCall` arm would;
//! 2. otherwise the receiver's static type decides, through the one rule
//!    `pycc_mir` also uses, [`receiver_takes_method_path`];
//! 3. anything else -- a container, a foreign object, a scalar, or a
//!    receiver whose type cannot be inferred -- takes the container reading,
//!    whose diagnostics are the ones such a call has always produced.
