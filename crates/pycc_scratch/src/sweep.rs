//! Bounded, best-effort removal of stale pycc scratch roots (issue #784,
//! Part 4 of #779).
//!
//! A pycc process that dies without running `Drop` (SIGKILL, power loss, a
//! `kill -9`'d test runner) leaves its scratch root behind. This module is
//! the defense-in-depth janitor: [`sweep_stale_roots`] scans the OS temp
//! directory and deletes roots whose creating process is provably dead,
//! under strict budgets so the caller's own latency stays bounded.
//!
//! # Safety bar
//!
//! The sweep deletes an entry only if it
//!
//! (a) fully parses as `pycc_{category}_{pid}_{nanos}_{seq}` with a
//!     non-empty category (the [D-201] ownership marker — parsed numbers
//!     are validation only, never trusted as timestamps),
//! (b) is a real directory (not a symlink — `DirEntry::file_type` does not
//!     follow symlinks, and `remove_dir_all` on a symlink-to-dir would only
//!     remove the link anyway),
//! (c) exceeds the age floor for its class ([`SweepConfig::min_age_locked`]
//!     for roots carrying a [`LOCK_FILE_NAME`] marker,
//!     [`SweepConfig::min_age_lockless`] for roots without an observable
//!     one — pre-Part-4 legacy roots, or a Part-4 root whose creator was
//!     killed before its lock file was created), and
//! (d) holds no live lock: a successful [`File::try_lock`] on the marker is
//!     kernel-backed proof the creator is dead, immune to PID reuse and
//!     released even on SIGKILL.
//!
//! The floors measure the directory's mtime, which tracks entry churn
//! (create/remove/rename inside the root), not last IO — good enough for
//! their purpose (covering the create-to-lock window, mid-`Drop` races, and
//! the marker-less population: pre-Part-4 legacy roots, or a Part-4 root
//! killed before its lock file was created), and stated plainly rather than
//! glossed as "activity". Every fallible step folds conservatively into a
//! skip; a concurrent sweep winning a deletion race is tolerated
//! (`NotFound` from `remove_dir_all` counts as already-deleted).
//!
//! One platform divergence, safe on both sides: a *directory* sitting at
//! the lock path (which no pycc process ever creates) opens fine on unix —
//! where `try_lock` on a directory fd acquires, so the root reads as dead
//! and is deleted once past the floor — while on Windows the open fails
//! non-`NotFound` and the root is conservatively skipped as an error.
