//! Shared RAII scratch-directory abstraction for pycc's production and test
//! code (issue #781, Part 1 of #779's 5-part decomposition).
//!
//! #779 found that ad hoc `std::env::temp_dir().join(...)` call sites across
//! ~36 test files (plus two production sites in `src/main.rs`, fixed
//! separately in Part 3) leaked directories whenever a test panicked before
//! its own manual `remove_dir_all` cleanup ran, and could collide when two
//! call sites in the same process picked the same name. [`ScratchDir`] fixes
//! both: `Drop`-based cleanup that runs even during a panic unwind, and a
//! naming scheme that cannot collide within a process and is vanishingly
//! unlikely to collide across processes.
//!
//! This crate intentionally has no dependencies beyond `std`. See the
//! decision record for why `tempfile`/`rand` were not added instead.
//!
//! Part 4 of #779 (issue #784) adds the second half of the lifecycle story:
//! every root carries a [`LOCK_FILE_NAME`] liveness marker held under an OS
//! advisory lock for the handle's lifetime, and [`sweep_stale_roots`]'s
//! bounded, best-effort sweep removes roots whose creating process is
//! provably dead (see the sweep module's docs for the exact safety bar).

///
/// # Naming and stability
///
/// Every directory this type creates is named
/// `pycc_{category}_{pid}_{nanos}_{seq}` under `std::env::temp_dir()`, where:
///
/// - `pid` is `std::process::id()`,
/// - `nanos` is the **full epoch nanosecond count** (a `u128` from
///   `SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)`'s `as_nanos()`), not just
///   the sub-second remainder — the field must span real time so that two
///   process restarts a few seconds apart that happen to reuse the same PID
///   still get distinguishable names. A wall clock set before the Unix
///   epoch degrades this field to `0` rather than panicking — `build`/`run`
///   promise an actionable exit-2 environment error, never a panic, and a
///   real collision under a degraded clock still surfaces as
///   `create_dir`'s `AlreadyExists` error through the fallible path below,
/// - `seq` is `SEQ`, a private per-process atomic counter that rules out any
///   same-process collision even when two calls land on the same nanosecond.
///
/// This field order and format are a stability commitment with a real
/// consumer since Part 4 (#784): [`sweep_stale_roots`] parses a
/// directory name back into its fields without a live handle and treats a
/// full-format match as proof of pycc ownership. Changing the format is a breaking
/// change for that consumer. Note the parsed numbers are used for
/// *validation only* — a pre-epoch clock degrades `nanos` to `0`, so the
/// sweep never treats it as a plausible creation time; staleness comes from
/// filesystem mtime and liveness from the lock file below.
///
/// # Liveness marker
///
/// Every fresh root also contains a [`LOCK_FILE_NAME`] file on which the
/// handle holds an exclusive advisory lock (see that constant's docs).
/// Lock *acquisition* failure is deliberately ignored: on a filesystem
/// without advisory-lock support the root simply degrades to the sweep's
/// age-floor-only protection instead of failing the user's build — failing
/// a build to protect a janitor would invert priorities.
