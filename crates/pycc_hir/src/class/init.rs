//! Constructor resolution and synthesis, extracted from
//! [`super::lower_class`] (D-185: decompose the part a change touches).
//!
//! Every class `lower_class` returns ends up with exactly one `__init__` in
//! its method table, and this module is where that guarantee is established.
//! A class that declares its own `__init__` keeps it; a class that declares
//! none inherits the nearest *real* one in its MRO (#432); a class with
//! neither gets an implicit zero-argument constructor synthesized here
//! (#912,
//! [D-225](../../../../docs/decisions/D-225-synthesize-an-implicit-zero-argument-constructor.md)),
//! matching CPython's inherited `object.__init__`.
//!
//! #966: because that implicit constructor lands in the class's *own*
//! method table, it would otherwise out-rank a real `__init__` declared by
//! a later base of a derived class. [`ensure_init`] therefore reports when
//! it synthesized one, `lower_class` records that on
//! [`HirClassDef::implicit_object_init`], and constructor resolution ranks
//! a flagged class last -- where CPython ranks `object.__init__`.
//!
//! [`synthesize_dataclass_init`] serves both callers: the dataclass path
//! passes the merged field list, and the implicit-constructor path passes an
//! empty one, which degenerates to `def __init__(self) -> None: pass`.
