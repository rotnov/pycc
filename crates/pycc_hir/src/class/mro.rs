//! Base-class resolution and C3 method-resolution-order computation
//! (`validate_bases`, `resolve_mro`, and the `compute_c3_mro` algorithm they

//! Extracted verbatim from `crates/pycc_hir/src/class.rs` per AGENTS.md's
//! file-decomposition rule and D-185's per-file tracking issue (#548): this
//! is one cohesion-driven seam of that 5,332-line file, not a rewrite. Every

//! The seam is "which bases are legal, and what order do they linearize
