//! Class-attribute names the interpreter reserves for itself, rejected in
//! every class body (#910, #975).
//!
//! Extracted from [`super::attrs`] under `AGENTS.md`'s "keep source files
//! decomposable" rule when #975 added the second name set below, because
//! `attrs.rs` is already past the ~1000-line bar.
//!
//! Two independent sets live here:
//!
//! * `__slots__` (#910), which Python reads as a declaration of the instance
//!   layout. This compiler fixes that layout at compile time from `__init__`
//!   (D-154), so the declaration would be silently discarded.
//! * The *instantiation and class-creation protocol* names (#975, D-236):
//!   `__init__`, `__new__` and `__init_subclass__`. The generating rule is
//!   "the names Python's object protocol calls implicitly rather than by
//!   name" -- `C()` runs `type.__call__` -> `__new__` -> `__init__`, and
//!   `class B(C)` runs `__init_subclass__` at class creation. Binding any of
//!   them as a class attribute makes CPython raise `TypeError` at the use
//!   site, while this compiler resolves each protocol without ever consulting
//!   a class attribute of that name -- so without this guard it silently
//!   accepts a program CPython rejects (D-198), which D-224 forbids.
//!
//! Scope notes that are easy to get wrong, all measured at `28a1b194`:
//!
//! * The set is **not** `ClassVar`-gated. `super::body`'s non-dataclass branch
//!   routes every `AnnAssign` to `lower_class_attr` regardless of the
//!   `ClassVar` wrapper, and #910's `Stmt::Assign` arm routes to
//!   `lower_unannotated_class_attr`, so `X: ClassVar[int] = 8`, `X: int = 8`
//!   and `X = 8` all reach the same hazard.
//! * The set deliberately does **not** include the other five names in
//!   `super::body`'s `DATACLASS_IMPLICIT_DUNDERS` (`__eq__`, `__repr__`,
//!   `__ne__`, `__str__`, `__format__`). Those are safe outside a dataclass
//!   *only because* every rewrite consulting them is `is_dataclass`-gated
//!   today (`pycc_mir/src/class.rs`'s early return, and `pycc_mir/src/expr.rs`'s
//!   `&& class_def.is_dataclass`). Ungating any of them for a plain class
//!   reintroduces the divergence and brings that name into this set.
//! * Conversely this set is checked in *every* class body, so it also closes
//!   the two names `DATACLASS_IMPLICIT_DUNDERS` omits (`__new__`,
//!   `__init_subclass__`) on the dataclass path, without disturbing the six
//!   messages that set already owns: `super::body` runs its own check first.
//! * `__init_subclass__`'s rejection is conservative on two different
//!   grounds. In an `Enum` body it can never diverge, because an `Enum` with
//!   members cannot be subclassed at all. In a plain class body it diverges
//!   only if the class is actually subclassed somewhere, which is
//!   whole-program information this class-body walk does not have. It is
//!   rejected in both for uniformity of the single rule, not because a
//!   divergence was measured at the declaration site.
