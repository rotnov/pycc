//! The instance-method receiver decision ([#1181](https://github.com/rotnov/pycc/issues/1181)).
//!
//! Extracted from `class.rs` per AGENTS.md's "Keep source files
//! decomposable" rule and D-185's per-pull-request narrowing of
//! [#548](https://github.com/rotnov/pycc/issues/548): everything that
//! answers "which parameter is the receiver, and is this method's receiver
//! acceptable?" for a *regular* instance method (including a `@property`
//! getter, a `@<name>.setter` setter, and an `@abstractmethod`) lives here.
//! `@classmethod`'s own `cls` rule and `@staticmethod`'s receiver-less
//! shape keep their own arms in `class.rs`'s method-kind `match`.
//!
//! THE RULE, stated once here:
//!
//! > An instance method's receiver is its **first positional parameter**,
//! > whatever identifier it is spelled with -- Python does not reserve
//! > `self`, it is a PEP 8 convention. The receiver is *lowered* under the
//! > canonical name `self` ([`super::lower_method`] writes it), and when the
//! > source spells it anything else the lowered body opens with an alias
//! > statement (`<name> = self`, [`alias_stmt`]) so the user's spelling is
//! > an ordinary local bound to the canonical receiver.
//!
//! Keeping the canonical name is what makes every downstream consumer that
//! keys on the name `self` -- `pycc_types::Environment`'s verbatim parameter
//! binding, `pycc_types::class::super_call`'s `binding_state("self")` test,
//! `pycc_mir::class`'s `lookup(scopes, "self")` -- correct without a change.
//! The aliasing is *invisible* for every program the compiler accepts,
//! because two guards ([`check_renamed_receiver`]) reject the only shapes
//! that could observe it:
//!
//! 1. **No occurrence of `self`.** Since the canonical parameter still
//!    exists, a method written `def m(this)` would otherwise accept a body
//!    mentioning `self`, which CPython raises `NameError` for (or, for a
//!    module-level global named `self`, resolves to the global -- pycc would
//!    resolve the parameter instead). Any read *or* binding of the
//!    identifier `self` anywhere in the method is rejected.
//! 2. **No rebinding of the receiver.** CPython's zero-argument `super()`
//!    reads the *current* value of the frame's first local, so a method that
//!    reassigns its receiver and then calls `super()` binds to the new
//!    value. The alias cannot reproduce that: `pycc_mir` looks up the
//!    canonical `self` parameter, which assigning to the alias leaves
//!    untouched. Rather than silently answering `1` where CPython answers
//!    `7`, any rebinding of the receiver name is rejected. This is a
//!    deliberate, documented narrowing of "usable wherever `self` is usable
//!    today"; it can be lifted by whichever future shape carries the source
//!    spelling into the parameter list itself.
//!
//! Both guards scan the **raw AST**, not the lowered HIR: shapes such as
//! `del` and `lambda` never lower at all, so a HIR scan would under-cover.
//! Both run *before* `stmt::lower_body`, because `global`, `nonlocal` and
//! `del` each report their own `C0001` from that pass and a scan placed
//! after it would never reach those arms with the receiver's own message.
