//! The class-body statement walk extracted from [`super::lower_class`]
//! (D-185: decompose the part a change touches).
//!
//! `lower_class` handles a class's *shape* -- decorators, bases, MRO
//! resolution, dataclass validation, and the synthesized `__init__`/`__eq__`/
//! `__repr__` of a `@dataclass`. This module owns the middle phase: the
//! single pass over `def.body` that classifies each statement, lowers every
//! method into a mangled `HirItem::Function`, and accumulates the tables
//! (`methods`, `attrs`, `properties`, `static_methods`, `class_methods`,
//! `dataclass_fields`, `abstract_methods`) that `lower_class` then folds into
//! the finished [`HirClassDef`].
//!
//! A plain (non-dataclass) body's value-less annotations are instance
//! attribute declarations (#1266): `super::declared_attrs` collects them
//! before the pass, the pass skips them, and `collect_init_attrs` takes their
//! declared types for the slots `__init__` establishes.
//!
//! Enum and protocol class bodies never reach this walk -- `lower_class`
//! returns through `lower_enum_class`/`lower_protocol_class` before it.

/// future change must re-apply: *the three methods pycc synthesizes for a
/// dataclass, plus every dunder CPython consults for an operation pycc
/// rewrites through one of those three.*
///
/// D-236 records that this rule is **not** the whole story: it cannot
/// generate `__new__` or `__init_subclass__`, which Python's instantiation
/// and class-creation protocols call implicitly without pycc rewriting
/// anything through them. Those two are owned by
/// [`super::reserved_names::reject_reserved_class_attr_name`], which applies
/// in *every* class body rather than only a dataclass one, so this set stays
/// exactly as D-235 accepted it. Keeping the two sets disjoint is deliberate:
/// this check runs before [`super::attrs::lower_class_attr`], so every
/// message below stays byte-for-byte what D-235 pinned, while the two names
/// it omits fall through to the universal guard.
///
/// - `__init__`, `__eq__`, `__repr__` -- synthesized unconditionally by
///   [`super::init::synthesize_dataclass_init`] and its siblings.
/// - `__ne__` -- `pycc_mir`'s `Eq`/`NotEq` rewrite spells `a != b` as
///   `not a.__eq__(b)` and never consults `__ne__`, which CPython tries
///   first.
/// - `__str__`, `__format__` -- `pycc_mir::class::rewrite_instance_to_repr`
///   rewrites both `print(instance)` and an f-string interpolation of one
///   straight to `__repr__`, while CPython routes them through `__str__` and
///   `__format__` respectively.
///
/// Verified against CPython 3.13.9: each of the six leaves the class
/// attribute in place, so the corresponding program raises
/// `TypeError: 'int' object is not callable` where pycc would silently
/// succeed. Dunders pycc does *not* rewrite for a dataclass stay off the
/// list: `__lt__` is already `T0021` ("cannot compare") before MIR, and
/// `__hash__` agrees with CPython because `dataclasses` leaves an explicitly
