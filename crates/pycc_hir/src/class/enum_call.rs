//! Spanned rejection of a call to an enum class (#921, #944).
//!
//! An enum class is constructor-less by design (`lower_enum_class`
//! early-returns before `class::init::ensure_init`, D-225): its members are
//! compile-time singletons, and CPython's `EnumType.__call__` value lookup
//! (`Color(1)`) is not implemented. #921 added a span-less guard in
//! `pycc_types::class::resolve_instantiation`, which renders the `C0001` at
//! `1:1` because `HirExpr` carries no spans. The one place a diagnostic can
//! still point at the call expression without threading spans through
//! `pycc_types` (#877) is an AST-level scan, so `lower_module` runs this
//! module once per top-level item, right after that item is lowered (`Ok`
//! or `Err` alike), and appends its diagnostics after the item's own so the
//! collection order stays the loop order D-217 rule 3 pins (see the D-233
//! amendment of D-219). `resolve_instantiation` keeps its guard behind this
//! scan (defense in depth), so the two "no `__init__` in the MRO" panics
//! describe an invariant that holds; the two rejections share
//! [`enum_class_call_message`] so they render identically.
//!
//! # Scope-local bindings
//!
//! The scan keys on a bare callee *name*, so it has to know when that name
//! is not the enum class at all: `def f(Color: int) -> None: Color()` is a
//! call on an `int` (`T0021` from `pycc_types`), and a bare-name scan would
//! turn that accurate diagnostic into a misleading enum-call `C0001`. The
//! walk therefore keeps a stack of *frames* -- the set of names bound
//! directly in one scope -- and reports a call only when no frame binds
//! the callee. There is one frame for the module body (computed once by
//! `lower_module` through [`module_bindings`]), one pushed around each
//! `def` (its parameter names plus the names its body binds), and one
//! pushed around each `lambda` (its parameter names). A frame records every
//! `Expr::Name` in `Store` context (assignment, augmented and annotated
//! assignment, `for`/`with`/walrus targets, tuple and starred targets,
//! comprehension targets), every `except ... as name`, and every `match`
//! capture (`case Color:`, `case [*Color]:`, `case {**Color}:`) -- those
//! last two groups are `Identifier`s rather than `Expr::Name`s, so the
//! `Store` rule alone would miss them. It records nothing else: not the
//! names of nested `def`/`class` statements and not `import` aliases (limit
//! (ii) below says why neither can matter on an item that lowers), and it
//! does not descend into a nested `def`, `class`, or `lambda`, so
//! `def g(): Color = 1` never suppresses a module-level `Color()`.
//!
//! # `TYPE_CHECKING` guards
//!
//! `lower_stmt` constant-folds an `if TYPE_CHECKING:` / `elif
//! TYPE_CHECKING:` body away as dead code (#790, D-223: a capability gap
//! inside such a body is deliberately not an error), and the scan walks the
//! original AST, so it has to fold the same bodies or it would reject a
//! module the lowering accepts (`if TYPE_CHECKING: Color(1)`, caught in
//! review of PR #971). Both walkers route every `if` through
//! `walk_if_as_lowered`, which skips a guarded body -- calls *and*
//! bindings, so a dead `Color = 1` does not shadow either -- using the very
//! `is_type_checking_guard` predicate the fold uses, against the same
//! import bindings the fold saw for that item. The live clauses around a
//! guard (a non-guard `if`, an `elif`, an `else`) are scanned normally.
//!
//! # Limits
//!
//! All of these are stated here rather than discovered later:
//!
//! - (i) **For an item that lowers, over-suppression is the only failure
//!   mode, never a false report.** A scope that binds the name *anywhere*
//!   suppresses the scan for the whole scope -- Python's own rule for a
//!   function; for the module frame it also hides a `Color()` that precedes
//!   a later module-level `Color = 1`, and a comprehension target
//!   `[Color for Color in range(3)]` suppresses a sibling `Color(1)` in the
//!   same `def`. Every suppressed call still fails in `pycc_types` (the
//!   span-less guard at `1:1`, or `T0021`). The one false-kind report is
//!   confined to a **class body**, which gets no frame: `class K:` with
//!   `Color = 1` and `X = Color()` reports the class-attribute `C0001` for
//!   `X = Color()` *and* an enum-call `C0001` at `Color()`, although Python
//!   resolves that name to the class-body `int`. Every class-body-level
//!   call already sits in a failing position (class attribute, base, or
//!   decorator), so this is only ever a second diagnostic on an item that
//!   fails anyway; a class frame was rejected because method bodies would
//!   inherit it and `class K: Color = 1` plus `def m(self): Color()` --
//!   correctly reported -- would be suppressed.
//! - (ii) `def`/`class` names and import aliases are not bindings in any
//!   frame, and that loses nothing on an item that lowers: at module level
//!   a `def Color`, a non-enum `class Color`, a `type Color = ...`, or an
//!   `import ... as Color` next to `class Color(Enum)` is a collision
//!   `C0001` in either source order, which poisons `Color` and so filters
//!   the scan; a `Color = 1` after `from colors import Color` is the
//!   "already defined by" `C0001`; and inside a function a nested
//!   `def`/`class`/`import` is itself a failing item, so the only effect of
//!   not modelling it is a possible second diagnostic on an item that
//!   already fails -- the same residual class as the class body. An
//!   imported enum (the `state.class_defs` half of `lower_module`'s name
//!   set) stays scannable.
//! - (iii) Decorators, default values, annotations, and the return
//!   annotation are scoped to the function they belong to rather than to
//!   the enclosing scope (the frame is pushed around ruff's whole
//!   `FunctionDef` walk). The only observable consequence is a missed
//!   *second* diagnostic on an item that already fails: a decorator or a
//!   default expression is `C0001 ... not supported yet` on its own.
//! - (iv) **Poison is order-dependent.** A `def` that calls `Color(1)` and
//!   *precedes* a failing `class Color(Enum): pass` is scanned before the
//!   class item fails and poisons `Color` (`poisoned` is filled only in the
//!   `Err` arm of `lower_module`'s loop), so that program yields two
//!   diagnostics -- the enum `C0001` at `Color(1)` first, then the
//!   class-body `C0001`. The extra report is true (the call *is* an enum
//!   call), so this is an accepted, pinned limit; the reverse order stays
//!   suppressed as a D-219 cascade. Likewise an enum imported by a
//!   statement *after* a `def` that calls it is unknown when that `def` is
//!   scanned and falls through to `pycc_types`' span-less guard.
//! - (v) `global`/`nonlocal` are not consulted (pycc does not lower them),
//!   and PEP 695 type parameters (`def f[Color](x: Color)`,
//!   `class K[Color]`) are not bindings -- they are `Identifier`s, not
//!   `Store` names. Both shapes lower and already reported the enum-call
//!   guard at `1:1`, so reporting at the call is the same diagnostic kind.
//! - (vi) **The module frame sees only the imports known before the
//!   loop.** `module_bindings` runs once, before `lower_module` lowers the
//!   module's own `import` statements, so a module-level guard spelled
//!   through an alias (`import typing as t` then `if t.TYPE_CHECKING:`)
//!   is not recognized there and a dead `Color = 1` inside it still lands
//!   in the module frame -- over-suppression only (the call fails in
//!   `pycc_types`). The bare `TYPE_CHECKING` and `typing.TYPE_CHECKING`
//!   spellings need no import binding and fold in the module frame too;
//!   inside a `def` the scan runs with the item's own import view, so the
//!   aliased spelling folds there.
//! - (vii) **A name bound by more than one module-level `def`, `class`,
//!   `import`, or `type` statement is never scanned** (an identical
//!   repeated import, `from colors import Color` twice, binds the same
//!   definition twice and is not a rebinding). `def Color()`,
//!   an ordinary `class Color`, `from m import Color`, or
//!   `type Color = int` beside `class Color(Enum)` is a collision that the
//!   class item reports itself (`... collides with a function / an import /
//!   a type alias of the same name ...`, `... defined more than once ...`),
//!   whichever comes second. A module-level `Color()` between the two
//!   resolves to the earlier binding, so scanning it against the syntactic
//!   pre-collection would report a *false-kind* `C0001` ahead of the real
//!   one (PR #971 review, two rounds). `lower_module` therefore drops every
//!   name in `module_rebound_names` from the scan's name set for the whole
//!   module, in either order: the collision diagnostic owns such a
//!   program, and a `def`-body call to the rebound name falls through to
//!   `pycc_types`' span-less guard as before #944. A plain assignment
//!   rebinding the name is the module frame's case already.
//! - A call with a keyword argument (`Color(value=1)`) is skipped:
//!   `lower_expr` already reports exactly one `C0001 keyword call arguments
//!   are not supported yet` at that call, and the scan runs on failed items
//!   too, so without the skip that program would carry two `C0001`s at one
//!   span. The skip is *not* extended to a starred argument (`Color(*xs)`):
//!   the starred `C0001` sits at `*xs`, a different span, and the call is a
//!   genuine enum call.
