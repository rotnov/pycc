//! Issue #618: reject an out-of-range `int` *literal* in one of D-141's
//! runtime `int`-boundary positions at compile time, restoring `pycc check`
//! as the catch point that D-178 (PR #617, closing #148) knowingly moved to
//! run time for the literal case.
//!
//! ## Why this lives entirely in `pycc_hir`
//!
//! D-178's own deferral note speculated the fix "needs a boundary-position
//! notion threaded across those 14 sites in three passes (HIR, MIR,
//! codegen)". D-179 already removed the `range()` operand from that
//! fourteen-position inventory before this issue was even filed --
//! `range()` is fully bigint-capable (bounds, step, and a mid-loop-promoting
//! induction variable, via `pycc_rt_range_normalize_operand`/
//! `pycc_rt_range_continue`), so an out-of-range literal there is ordinary
//! supported behavior, not a boundary failure, and this module deliberately
//! does not check it (see `crate::expr::lower_range_call`'s own comment).
//! That leaves 13 positions, and investigation for this issue found the
//! "three passes" estimate inaccurate for all of them: every one is
//! resolved to a dedicated HIR node (or a dedicated argument slot of one)
//! purely syntactically, during HIR lowering itself, with no type
//! information from `pycc_types` or MIR needed to identify the position --
//! `list.append`/`dict.get`/`set.add` are already recognized by bare-name
//! receiver + attribute name (see `crate::expr::lower_expr`'s `Expr::Call`
//! arm), and `list`/`dict`/`set` literals, subscripts, and slices are
//! recognized directly from the AST shape. `pycc
//! check` itself runs only `pycc_hir::lower_checked` followed by
//! `pycc_types::check` (see `src/main.rs`'s `check_frontend`) -- neither
//! step reaches MIR or codegen -- so a check that fires during HIR lowering
//! is sufficient on its own to make `pycc check` catch the defect, without
//! opening up `pycc_mir` or `pycc_codegen` at all.
//!
//! The last of those 13 positions -- `str` repeat count (`<str> *
//! <int-literal>` or `<int-literal> * <str>`) -- is intentionally narrower:
//! `pycc_hir` has no
//! type information, so it cannot tell a `str`-typed *variable* multiplied
//! by an oversized literal from ordinary `int * int` multiplication (which
//! is not a boundary position at all after D-178 -- an oversized literal
//! there just materializes as a heap bigint, exactly as intended). This
//! module therefore only recognizes the case where the string side is
//! itself a string *literal*, which needs no type inference and is
//! resolvable from the AST shape alone, in `crate::expr::lower_expr`'s
//! `Expr::BinOp` arm. A `str`-typed variable multiplied by an oversized
//! literal keeps today's runtime-abort behavior; catching that case too
//! would require threading a span-bearing type facts into `pycc_types`
//! (which currently has none -- see its pervasively reused
//! `Span::new(0, 0)`), a materially larger, separate architectural change
//! this issue's own completion criteria do not ask for.
//!
//! ## Why the range check is duplicated a third time
//!
//! `fits_tagged_smallint` below mirrors `pycc_rt::fits_smallint` and
//! `pycc_codegen::int_const::fits_tagged_smallint` exactly (same D-061
//! encoding, same round-trip check). `pycc_hir` cannot depend on
//! `pycc_codegen` (codegen depends on `pycc_mir`, which depends on
//! `pycc_hir` -- the reverse dependency would be circular), and it cannot
//! depend on `pycc_rt` either (no crate in the compiler's own build links
//! against the target runtime as an ordinary Rust dependency; `pycc_codegen`
//! already mirrors it for the same reason, per its own `int_const.rs` doc
//! comment). A third small, independently tested mirror of a five-line
//! invariant is judged cheaper here than adding a dependency edge purely to
//! share it.
