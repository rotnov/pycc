/// independently.
///
/// A single-name handler (`names.len() == 1`, including `except (A,):` and
/// bare-comma `except A,:`) binds to that exact name, matching `except A:`.
///
/// A genuinely multi-type handler (`names.len() > 1`) binds to
/// `"Exception"`, the universal builtin root, rather than to the
/// first-listed name. An earlier version of this helper always picked
/// `names[0]` (see the D-195 decision entry's now-superseded rationale);
/// that choice was unsound for `isinstance()`, not just imprecise.
/// `isinstance()` in this compiler folds entirely at compile time from the
/// object's *static* `Ty::Instance` type's MRO
/// (`pycc_mir::class::lower_isinstance`,
/// `pycc_hir::typecheck::eval_isinstance_single`) -- there is no runtime
/// type check. Binding `except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:` to
/// `"ValueError"` made `isinstance(e, ValueError)` fold to a constant
/// `True` even when the handler actually caught a `TypeError`: a false
/// *positive*, worse than the pre-existing, already-accepted imprecision
/// for single-type handlers (which can only produce false *negatives* on
/// subclass-narrowing queries, since a single declared type is always a
/// genuine ancestor of anything that handler can catch). Binding to
/// `"Exception"` instead means `"Exception"`'s own MRO contains no
/// descendant name, so `isinstance(e, AnySpecificType)` on a multi-type
/// handler's binding folds to `False` -- a conservative false negative, in
/// the same already-accepted-imprecision class as the single-type case,
/// never a false positive. `raise e` (bare-name re-raise) is unaffected by
/// this choice either way: it lowers to `MirExceptionValue::Existing`,
/// which preserves the actual runtime exception object and tag rather than
/// reconstructing from this static binding type
/// (`pycc_mir::exception::lower_exception_value`).
///

/// Panics if `names` is empty. `HirExceptHandler::exc_type` is documented
/// as never containing an empty `Vec`, so callers passing that field's
