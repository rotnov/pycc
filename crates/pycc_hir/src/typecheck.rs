//! public API rather than crate-internal, so `lib.rs` re-exports all eight
//! items and the `pycc_hir::is_builtin_type_name`-style paths are unchanged
//! by the move. Counting non-comment references outside `lib.rs`:
//! `is_builtin_type_name` 7 in `tests.rs`, 2 in `pycc_mir`, 2 in
//! `pycc_types`; `eval_isinstance_single` 15 and 2; `eval_issubclass_single`
//! 12 and 2; `extract_class_names` 6, 3, and 3; the three base-name
//! predicates 1-2 each, all from this crate's `class.rs`.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Issue #435: compile-time `isinstance`/`issubclass` evaluation helpers.
//
// pycc uses static dispatch (D-006) — `is_assignable` does not allow
// `Ty::Instance("D")` to be assigned to `Ty::Instance("B")`, so every
// variable's runtime type is exactly its declared static type. Therefore
// `isinstance` and `issubclass` can always be evaluated at compile time,
// emitting constant boolean values. No runtime type tags or RTTI are needed.
//
// These helpers are shared by `pycc_types` (type checker) and `pycc_mir`
// (MIR lowering) so both compute identical results from the same inputs.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
