//! A CPython-backed `import` nested in a module-level `if`/`try` block
//! (Part 1 of #1282, #1291).
//!
//! [`lower_block_imports`] runs before a module-level `if`/`try` statement
//! is lowered. It lowers each `import` statement nested in the block
//! exactly as a top-level one would be lowered, and keeps a statement's
//! bindings only when every alias is foreign. `module::lower_top_level_item`
//! pushes those bindings, with [`ForeignImportSite::Block`] (optional when a
//! `try` whose handler catches a failed import guards it, #1290), onto the
//! module's import table before lowering the block, so the driver's lock,
//! policy and native-build gates see them. `lower_stmt` then turns the
//! statement into [`HirStmt::ForeignImport`] through
//! [`nested_foreign_import`], which finds its bindings by the statement's
//! span.
