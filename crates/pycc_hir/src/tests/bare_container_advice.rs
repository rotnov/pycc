//! Unit tests for D-228's bare-container annotation advice (issue #918):
//! which annotation positions upgrade the generic unknown-name `C0001` for a
//! bare `list`/`set`/`dict`/`tuple` into the parameterized-form message.
//!
//! Extracted from `tests.rs` per AGENTS.md's file-decomposition rule when
//! #1266 moved the class-body declaration (`class C: xs: list`) into the
//! advising set. `assert_capability_error_message` stays in the parent and is
//! reached through `use super::*`.
