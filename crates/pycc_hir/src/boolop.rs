//! `and`/`or` (#1211, Part 3 of #1018): the operator kind, the value-context
//! result-type join shared by `pycc_types` and `pycc_mir`, and the
//! truth-context marker HIR lowering applies to condition positions.
//!
//! A boolean operator is lowered in one of two contexts (see
//! [`HirExpr::BoolOp`]'s `truth_only` field):
//!
//! * **Truth context** -- an `if`/`elif`/`while` test, a comprehension `if`
//!   filter, or the operand of `not`. Only the truth of the result is
//!   observed, so the node is typed `bool` and its operands need only be
//!   truth-testable; `if n > 0 and name:` over `int` and `str` is fine.
//! * **Value context** -- everywhere else. The node yields the selected
//!   operand itself, so both operands must join to one type
//!   ([`bool_op_result_ty`]). pycc has no union types, so a pair with no
//!   common type is refused rather than widened.
//!
//! [`mark_truth_context`] descends only through a `BoolOp` and a `not`. It
//! must not descend through a walrus (`if (x := a or b):` binds `x` to the
//! selected *value*) or through a comparison, call or any other node (`if (a
//! or b) == c:` compares the selected value). A `match` guard is not a truth
//! position either: the checker requires a guard to be `bool`, and treating
//! `case _ if n and s` as truth context would admit it while `case _ if n`
//! over an `int` stays refused.
