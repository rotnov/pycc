//! Receiver-dispatched calls to `append`, `pop`, `get` and `add` (issue
//! #1188).
//!
//! `container_call` claims `x.append(v)`, `x.pop()`, `d.get(k, default)` and
//! `s.add(v)` from their spelling alone, because HIR lowering runs before any
//! type exists. That is exact in a module that cannot see a user class with a
//! method of one of those names, and such a module keeps lowering exactly as
//! before. In a module that can (`SignatureTable::dispatches_on_receiver`),
//! the same spelling may equally be a call to the user's method, so this
//! module lowers *both* readings and records them in one
//! [`HirExpr::ReceiverDispatchedCall`]. `pycc_types` and `pycc_mir` then pick
//! a reading from the receiver's static type, through the one shared rule in
//! [`receiver_takes_method_path`].
