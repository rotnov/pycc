//! Module-level lowering: the single left-to-right walk over a module's
//! top-level statements that dispatches each one to the alias, import,
//! class, function, or statement lowering in the sibling modules and
//! assembles the resulting `HirModule`.
//!
//! Extracted from `lib.rs` per AGENTS.md's file-decomposition rule (issue
//! #867): the crate root keeps the HIR data types and the diagnostic
//! constructors; the walk itself lives here. `lib.rs` re-exports
//! `lower_all` and `lower_checked` so the `pycc_hir::lower_checked` path is
//! unchanged.
//!
//! #898 (D-222) splits the walk from the program-level phases that used to
//! follow it: `lower_module` is the per-module walk (against the driver's
//! `ResolvedImports` answers for the module's project imports), and
//! `program::link` + `program::finalize` combine any number of lowered
//! modules into one program and run the post-loop phases (exception type
//! tags, `Exception.__init__`). `lower_all` is the single-file composition
//! of the two and is byte-identical to what it produced before the split.
//!
//! Part 2 of #864 (#867, D-219): the walk collects one diagnostic per
//! failing top-level item instead of stopping at the first. A failing item
//! is skipped as a unit -- a `def` aborts only that function, a failing
//! method aborts its whole class -- and lowering continues with the next
//! item. Some `C0001` shapes are *cascades* of an earlier skipped item rather
//! than independent gaps: a bare-name or bare-container annotation that
//! names a class, type alias, or import which failed to lower, and a base-class
//! reference to one (whether its message says "unknown class" or, since
//! Part 1 of #1283, "builtin type").
//! The lowering source suppresses those silently through the "poisoned
//! bindings" set kept by `lower_module` (see `poisonable_names` and
//! `cascade_name`); everything else it produces is reported. The suppression
//! covers the lowering source only: the #944 per-item enum-call scan (D-233,
//! `class::enum_call`) runs after every item whatever its outcome, so a
//! cascade-silenced item can still report a true enum-call `C0001` of its
//! own. HIR failures still stop the pipeline before the type
//! checker (`src/frontend.rs`), so no partial module is ever type-checked.
