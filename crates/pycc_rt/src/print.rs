//! `print`'s stdout primitives (moved out of `lib.rs`, AGENTS.md's "Keep
//! source files decomposable"; the tracker for the rest of `lib.rs` is

//!
//! Every write goes through Rust's own line-buffered stdout, which is
//! separate from CPython's `sys.stdout`. [`pycc_rt_print_flush`] (#1340)
//! empties it before compiled code hands control to CPython in the middle

use crate::PyStrObj;

/// Writes a `PyStrObj`'s bytes to stdout with no trailing newline (Task 10)
/// -- `print`'s new fully-general dispatch converts every argument to a
/// `str` via `to_str` first (reusing `pycc_rt_int_to_str`/`float_to_str`/
/// `bool_to_str`) and writes each one with this, separated by
/// `pycc_rt_print_space` and finished by `pycc_rt_print_newline`. Distinct
/// from Task 3's `pycc_rt_int_print`, which stays newline-inclusive and
/// int-only and is no longer called by `pycc_codegen`'s print dispatch
/// (still exercised by its own direct unit tests below). Never panics --
/// `String::from_utf8_lossy` cannot fail -- so this needs no
/// private-logic/public-wrapper split (same reasoning as `pycc_rt_str_from_
/// literal`'s own doc comment).
///
/// Deviation from the task brief: the brief's own version of this function
/// signature was a plain (non-`unsafe`) `pub extern "C" fn`, matching its
/// dereference of `s` (`*s`) inside its own internal `unsafe { }` block.
/// That doesn't compile clean under this crate's `-D warnings` clippy gate
/// -- `clippy::not_unsafe_ptr_arg_deref` (`#[deny]`d by default) rejects
/// exactly this shape: a public function taking a raw pointer and
/// dereferencing it without the function itself being `unsafe`. Every other
/// function in this file that dereferences a `*mut PyStrObj`
/// (`pycc_rt_str_from_literal`/`_concat`/`_cmp`/`_truthy`/`_incref`/
/// `_decref`) is already `pub unsafe extern "C" fn` for exactly this
/// reason; fixed the same way here, and documented with its own `# Safety`
/// section per that same established convention.
///
/// # Safety
/// `s` must be a live `*mut PyStrObj` previously returned by one of this
/// crate's own str-producing functions (same contract as
/// `pycc_rt_str_incref`/`pycc_rt_str_decref`).
