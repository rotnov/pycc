//! D-244 rule 2's `PyObject*` boundary, runtime half: the one place that
//! decides how a CPython `int`/`bool` becomes a D-141 encoded word and back.
//!
//! **What lives here and what does not, and why.** Rule 2 requires the
//! unpack/pack layer to live in `pycc_rt` rather than being reinvented per
//! mode, so that `--ext` (#1025) and the embedded executable (#1028) share
//! one boundary. It does *not* require `pycc_rt` to call CPython, and it must
//! not: `libpycc_rt.a` is linked into every `native` executable too, where no
//! interpreter exists. A `PyErr_SetString` reference reachable from an
//! ordinary archive member would make every native link fail on an undefined
//! symbol -- or, worse, succeed only by accident of which archive members the
//! linker happened to pull in. So the split is by *dependency*, not by
//! convenience: every rule the boundary has (the inline-integer range, D-141's
//! bool markers, the four-way classification of an encoded word, the pending
//! exception's type and message) is decided here, in ordinary Rust with no
//! foreign symbols, and the fixed C shim (`src/ext/pycc_ext_module.c`) does
//! nothing but move `PyObject*`s according to the answers.
//!
//! That split is also what makes this boundary testable at all: everything in
//! this module is a pure function over `i64`s, so every arm -- including the
//! two `OverflowError` arms the D-244 amendment introduces -- is executed by
//! ordinary unit tests on a host with no CPython headers, which is exactly the
//! environment the coverage gate runs in.
//!
//! **The boundary is the inline-integer range, never `i64`.** `fits_smallint`
//! accepts `[-2^62, 2^62-1]`; `pycc_rt_int_from_i64` promotes anything outside
//! it to a bigint-tagged word, whereupon the compiled body's first
//! `require_inline_int` panics, which across a plain `extern "C"` boundary is a
//! process abort -- i.e. a killed interpreter. An ingress check written against
//! `i64` would let `f(4611686018427387905)` do exactly that. See the D-244
//! amendment and #1040.
