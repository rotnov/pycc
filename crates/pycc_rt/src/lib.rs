//! # Build order: this crate's staticlib is not a normal Cargo dependency
//!
//! This crate's real consumer is not Rust code but pycc-generated object
//! files, which reference `pycc_rt_print_i64` by symbol name and are
//! linked against this crate's `staticlib` output (`libpycc_rt.a` on
//! Unix-like targets, `pycc_rt.lib` on `-msvc` targets -- see D-028) via a
//! linker-driver invocation (`cc`, or on Windows the bundled `clang` --
//! see D-028) -- in `pycc_codegen`'s own tests (`link_object_with_runtime`)
//! and in `pycc`'s real `build`/`run` (`src/main.rs`). Nothing in Cargo's
//! normal dependency graph expresses that relationship: Cargo does not
//! uplift a `staticlib` reached through an ordinary `[dependencies]` edge
//! to a predictable path, and `cargo test` does not build the `staticlib`
//! crate type at all. So neither `cargo build --workspace` nor
//! `cargo test --workspace` can be relied on to leave the archive where
//! anything looks for it.
//!
//! **This is now handled automatically.** `pycc_codegen`'s build script
//! (`crates/pycc_codegen/build.rs`) runs `cargo build --locked -p pycc_rt`
//! for *both* host profiles into a private directory under its own
//! `OUT_DIR`, then installs the resulting archive at `<target-root>/debug/`
//! and `<target-root>/release/` -- the directories
//! `pycc_artifact_layout::find_pycc_rt_lib_dir_in` searches. Because every
//! path into the compiler goes through `pycc_codegen`, a clean checkout
//! builds and tests with no manual step: `cargo build -p pycc_rt` is no
//! longer a prerequisite for `cargo test -p pycc_codegen` or for
//! `cargo run --bin pycc -- build ...`. See
//! `docs/decisions/D-184-build-pycc-rt-from-pycc-codegen-s-build.md`.
//!
//! The deadlock that made an earlier attempt at this unworkable was real
//! and is avoided rather than wished away: a build script that invokes
//! `cargo` at the *same* build directory blocks forever on Cargo's own
//! build-directory lock, which the outer invocation holds for the whole
//! build-script execution. The nested build therefore gets its own
//! `--target-dir` under `OUT_DIR`. This crate declaring no dependencies at
//! all is what keeps that nested build cheap and keeps it from contending
//! for `$CARGO_HOME/.package-cache`; `tests/issue_630_pycc_rt_build_dependency.rs`
//! asserts that property so it cannot be lost silently.
//!
//! Cross-compilation is still explicit. When `pycc build --target <triple>`
//! names a triple this workspace was not itself built for, run
//! `rustup target add <triple>` and
//! `cargo build [--release] --target <triple> -p pycc_rt` first; the build
//! script only produces the host's archives, and the diagnostic says so.

// --- Implementation note / deviation from the task brief -------------
//
// The brief's own doc comment (kept, below, as the historical record of
// the *intended* design) claims that a panic raised by calling one of
// these `pycc_rt_int_*` functions directly from this crate's own Rust
// test code "is an ordinary, same-binary unwind the test harness
// catches -- no FFI boundary is crossed during the test itself." That
// claim does not hold on this toolchain (rustc 1.97.1): whether a panic
// unwinding past a function's own boundary gets caught and turned into
// an abort is a property of *that function's own* declared ABI, decided
// at the point the function itself is compiled -- not of who happens to
// call it. A plain `extern "C" fn` (not `extern "C-unwind"`) always gets
// this abort-on-unwind landing pad around its own body, so calling it
// directly from ordinary same-crate Rust test code panics into a
// `SIGABRT` (confirmed empirically: the `#[should_panic]` tests below
// aborted the whole test binary instead of being caught, before this
// split existed).
//
// The *intent* behind choosing plain `extern "C"` is still correct and
// worth keeping: pycc-generated LLVM IR has no personality routine/unwind
// tables, so a real unwind escaping into it would be genuinely unsafe --
// converting that into a deterministic abort right at this boundary is
// the right call for the actual compiled-program scenario. Only the
// "therefore it's directly unit-testable with `#[should_panic]`" half of
// the claim was wrong.
//
// Fix: split each `pycc_rt_int_*` symbol into a private, ordinary-Rust-ABI
// function holding the real logic (freely panics, unwinds normally, so
// `#[should_panic]` can catch it when called directly) and a thin
// `#[unsafe(no_mangle)] pub extern "C" fn` wrapper of the exact name/
// signature the brief specifies, which every later task's codegen still
// calls unchanged. Tests exercising a panicking path call the private
// function directly; tests only checking a successful return value keep
// calling the public wrapper (also exercising the wrapper's own line, no
// unwind ever crosses its boundary on those paths).

// --- Implementation note / deviation from the task brief -------------
//
// The brief's own Step 2 code makes `pycc_rt_range_continue` a single
// plain `extern "C" fn`, with a Step 1 `#[should_panic]` test calling that
// same public wrapper directly for the zero-step case. Per this crate's
// own established convention (see the implementation-note comment above
// `int_add`, discovered empirically during Task 3): a panic that unwinds
// past a plain `extern "C" fn`'s own boundary is caught right there and
// turned into a process abort, regardless of who calls it -- including
// this crate's own same-binary Rust tests. `pycc_rt_range_continue` *can*
// still panic (`classify_encoded_int`'s fail-closed rejection of a
// malformed encoded word), so it keeps the same split every other panicking
// `pycc_rt_int_*` function already gets: a private, ordinary-Rust-ABI
// `range_continue` holding the real logic (freely panics, unwinds
// normally, `#[should_panic]`-testable), and a thin `pub extern "C"`
// wrapper of the exact brief-specified name/signature for pycc-generated
// code to call. Since #150 (D-173's pending-exception mechanism), the
// zero-step case no longer panics -- it raises a `ValueError` and returns
// the ordinary "stop" sentinel instead -- so the tests for that case below
// assert the pending exception state rather than `#[should_panic]`.
//
// Since #147 the operands are ordered through `encoded_int_cmp` rather than
// decoded to an inline value, so a bigint start, stop, step, or
// mid-loop-promoted induction variable drives the loop normally instead of
// aborting at D-141's runtime `int` boundary. Note the zero-step check reads
// the *step's own encoded order against zero*, not the raw word: a bigint
// zero step (reachable via `a - a` on two promoted values) is still rejected,
// and a bigint word is never numerically `0`.
//
// D-173 (#382) established a pending-exception mechanism (`raise_builtin`)
// for exactly this shape of runtime failure boundary: since #150, a zero
// step sets a `ValueError` (CPython's own `range() arg 3 must not be zero`
// message) instead of panicking, and returns `0` -- the same sentinel this
// function already returns for ordinary loop exhaustion. No codegen change
// was needed for that to surface reliably: a `0` return makes the enclosing
// `for`/comprehension loop exit exactly as if it had completed normally, and
// that statement is then subject to the same pre-existing
// `pycc_rt_exception_active` checkpoints every other D-173 exception already
// relies on (the top-level statement loop and the `try`-body per-statement
// check in `pycc_codegen`) -- mirroring `float_div`'s own scope exactly: any
// context other than the top-level statement loop or a `try` body observes
// the pending exception only at the next enclosing checkpoint, not
// immediately, which is an existing, accepted D-173 characteristic rather
// than a new gap this change introduces (see
// `uncaught_zero_step_range_inside_a_function_body_is_observed_at_the_next_checkpoint`
// in `tests/issue_150_zero_step_range.rs`, which pins the exact observed

// gave each straight to a single `#[unsafe(no_mangle)] pub extern "C" fn`
// (no private-logic/public-wrapper split). Both can panic --
// `int_to_str` via the encoded-int classifier's rejection path (not yet
// exercised by any test in *this* task, since Task 9 is what first makes a
// bigint-valued tagged `int` reachable, but still a real panicking path
// today), `float_to_str` via its own scientific-notation-range rejection
// (directly exercised by this task's own tests) -- and both are plain
// `extern "C" fn`s, not `extern "C-unwind"`. Per this file's own
// established convention (see the implementation note above `int_add`,
// and this crate's project-wide rule that any new `pycc_rt` `extern "C"
// fn` that can panic needs this split), calling either public wrapper
// directly from ordinary same-crate Rust test code would abort the whole
// test binary (`SIGABRT`) instead of letting `#[should_panic]` catch an
// ordinary unwind -- confirmed empirically: `pycc_rt_float_to_str_rejects_
// magnitudes_needing_scientific_notation` aborted the test binary before
// this split existed. Fixed the same way as `int_add`/`pycc_rt_int_add`:
// a private, ordinary-Rust-ABI function holding the real logic (freely
// panics, unwinds normally) and a thin `#[unsafe(no_mangle)] pub extern
// "C" fn` wrapper of the exact name/signature the brief specifies.
// `bool_to_str` has no failure mode (same reasoning as `pycc_rt_str_from_
