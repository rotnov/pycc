//! Where `pycc` looks for build artifacts it did not produce itself.
//!
//! `pycc build` links the compiled object against `pycc_rt`'s static
//! library, which Cargo has already placed somewhere under the *Cargo
//! target directory*. That directory is not always `<workspace>/target`:
//! Cargo lets it be redirected, and this project's own coverage job does
//! exactly that (see `docs/TESTING.md`). Everything that needs to locate a
//! Cargo-produced artifact resolves it through this module rather than
//! joining `"target"` onto a manifest directory, so a redirected target
//! directory is honored uniformly by the compiler driver, by
//! `pycc_codegen`'s own link-and-run tests, and by the CLI integration
//! tests. `tests/target_dir_literals.rs` is the mechanical gate that keeps
//! it that way.
//!
//! This lives in its own workspace member rather than inside
//! `pycc_codegen` because `pycc_codegen`'s build script needs the same
//! resolution rules the library uses, and a crate cannot depend on itself.
//! `pycc_codegen` takes it under both `[dependencies]` and
//! `[build-dependencies]` and re-exports it as
//! `pycc_codegen::artifact_layout`, so every pre-existing path through that
//! module name still resolves. See
//! `docs/decisions/D-184-build-pycc-rt-from-pycc-codegen-s-build.md`.

/// The directory name Cargo uses when the target directory is not

///    this is Cargo's generic config-to-environment mapping of the

///    not any `.cargo/config.toml` exists. Verified on this project's dev
///    host, not assumed: `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET_DIR=<dir> cargo build` puts
///    artifacts in `<dir>/debug` and creates no local `target/` at all,
///    and with both variables set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` wins and the

/// 3. otherwise `<manifest_dir>/target`.
///
/// An empty value at either level is treated as unset. This is a

/// rejects the build outright (`CARGO_TARGET_DIR= cargo build` exits 101
/// with "the target directory is set to an empty string in the

/// for an artifact someone else built has no equivalent of that abort:
/// honoring the empty string would resolve artifacts to a bare relative
/// `debug/`, which is worse than falling back, and an
/// exported-but-empty variable is a common shell accident rather than an

///
/// A relative value is passed through unchanged rather than being joined
/// onto `manifest_dir`. Cargo resolves a relative target directory against
/// the working directory of the process that invoked *it*; `pycc` is a
/// separate process, so passing the value through agrees with Cargo

/// config discovery -- `$CARGO_HOME` merge, Cargo's own precedence and
