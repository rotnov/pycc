//! D-244's hosted `ext` artifact mode, as codegen sees it.
//!
//! Everything here answers one question -- *who calls the synthetic
//! module-body entry point, and what does it return when the body raises* --
//! and nothing here touches LLVM. `native` mode's answer is "the process
//! loader, and `main` never comes back from an uncaught exception"; `ext`'s
//! is "the C shim's `Py_mod_exec` slot, and it returns `-1` with the pending
//! exception handed to CPython". The option struct that selects between them
//! and the two symbol-name predicates that implement the distinction live
//! together so the naming invariant cannot drift across a 9000-line file
//! (AGENTS.md's "Keep source files decomposable"; the tracker for the rest
//! of `lib.rs` is #545).
//!
//! #1050 added a second, closely related question -- *what shape does a
//! public export present to the generated C wrapper* -- and the answer is
//! the `pycc_ext_thunk_<name>` convention below. It lives here rather than
//! in `ext_thunk.rs` because the driver (`src/ext_build.rs`) renders C
//! against exactly this convention and must agree with it symbol for symbol
//! and width for width, while `ext_thunk.rs` is the LLVM emission that
//! implements it.
