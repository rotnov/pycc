/// Whether evaluating `expr` produces a *duplicate* (borrowed) reference to
/// an already-owned `str` rather than a fresh object owning exactly one
/// reference from its own construction. This doc comment is the canonical
/// list of borrowed `str` reads; every other description of it
/// cross-references this function. The classification is purely
/// syntactic. The borrowed reads are exactly the nodes the `matches!` below
/// names: a bare `str`-typed `Name`, a `str`-typed `AttrGet`, and
/// `ExceptionMessage`. Every other str-producing expression
/// (`StringLiteral`, string concatenation, an f-string, a `Call`'s return
/// value, a `BoolOp`, ...) freshly constructs its result and already owns
/// exactly one reference (D-060, Task 7).
///
/// Gated on `ty: Ty::Str`, not just the bare-`Name` shape (Task 5, D-089).
/// The gate was originally added because `emit_expr`'s `Name` arm carried a
/// `Ty::List(_)`-typed read in `Scalar::Str` too, which made a bare
/// `list[T]`-typed `Name` indistinguishable from a `str`-typed one at the
/// `Scalar` level -- and `incref_if_str_duplicate` below dispatches on the
/// `Scalar` variant alone, so without the gate it would have called
/// `pycc_rt_str_incref` on a list pointer.
///
/// Task 11a (D-107) removed that reuse: a list read is now `Scalar::List`,
/// so the two are no longer confusable and this gate is no longer what
/// prevents the spurious incref. It is kept because it is independently the
/// correct contract for this function -- it answers "is this a duplicate
/// reference to an already-owned *`str`*", and a non-`str` `Name` is not
/// one, whatever `Scalar` variant it happens to produce. Behavior-identical
/// either way for every reachable case: `incref_if_str_duplicate` only ever
/// consults this function *after* confirming `scalar` is `Scalar::Str`.
///
/// `MirExpr::AttrGet { ty: Ty::Str, .. }` (D-154, Part 1 of #375) is a
/// duplicate reference for exactly the same reason a bare `Name` is: the
/// instance's own slot keeps its copy of the pointer after this read
/// returns one too, so both `to_str`'s pass-through and every ordinary
/// store site (`Assign`, a call argument, a dict key/value, ...) would
/// otherwise treat this read's result as freshly-owned and eventually
/// decref it once too many, underflowing the refcount and freeing the
/// `PyStrObj` while the instance's own slot still points at it -- a
/// reliably reproducible use-after-free caught in review, not merely a
/// theoretical gap (D-154 Part 1's own post-merge finding).
///
/// A `MirExpr::BoolOp` (#1211) is owning here, like every node this
/// `matches!` does not name: each of its value arms increfs a duplicate
/// operand inside that arm, so its `str` result is always a fresh reference.
///
/// `MirExpr::ExceptionMessage` (#1298) -- `print(e)` and `f"{e}"` on a caught
/// exception binding -- is a duplicate reference for the same field-load
/// reason as `AttrGet`: `pycc_rt_exception_message` returns the exception's
/// own `message` pointer borrowed and unretained, and the exception keeps
/// owning it after the read. Classifying it as owning made every rendering
/// release a reference it never took, so the second `print(e)` read freed
/// memory.
