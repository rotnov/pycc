//! Module-global `object` slots own their reference (Part 1 of #1499,
//! [#1501](https://github.com/rotnov/pycc/issues/1501)).
//!
//! **The invariant.** A module-global `object` slot (`pyglobal_<name>`)
//! holds exactly one owned `PyObject *` reference, or null. Every store into
//! one goes through [`store_owned`]:
//!
//! - a *produced* value -- a new reference [`is_owned`] recognises -- moves
//!   into the slot;
//! - every other source is borrowed, and [`retain_if_borrowed`] takes a
//!   reference of its own through the shim's `pycc_ext_obj_retain`
//!   (`Py_XINCREF`) before the store. An unlisted source is borrowed, so a
//!   source this module misclassifies over-retains and leaks; it never
//!   frees an object something else still names.
//! - a rebind stores the new value first and releases the old one after,
//!   the `Py_XSETREF` order. The release can run an arbitrary `__del__`,
//!   and that finalizer can call a compiled function that reads the global:
//!   it must see the new value, never a freed one. Storing first also makes
//!   `x = x` correct.
//! - the release runs only while the rebinding exec is the artifact's only
//!   live compiled activation (`pycc_ext_obj_rebind_may_release`, #1501);
//!   otherwise the old value leaks, because another activation -- a nested
//!   exec, an exec on another thread, a compiled call a host entered
//!   through a wrapper -- may still use it borrowed (see [`owned_bit`]).
//!
//! The stores are a module-level `x = <object>` (`MirStmt::Assign`), a
//! module-level `for x in <object>:` target ([`store_new_reference`], whose
//! per-trip item is `pycc_ext_obj_iter_next`'s new reference), and a
//! foreign import's binding (`foreign_import.rs`, the module or attribute
//! the import helpers return as a new reference).
//!
//! **The owned bit.** Each `object` global has a companion `i8` global,
//! `pyglobal.owned.<name>` (a dot no Python identifier contains, so it
//! cannot collide with a user global). The module-exec entry clears every
//! bit before its first statement, with a raw store ([`declare_owned_bits`]);
//! [`store_owned`] sets it, and releases the old value only when the bit it
//! loaded was set. A value an *earlier* exec stored -- a failed import
//! retried, a module re-imported after `del sys.modules[name]` -- was
//! stored before this exec's bits existed, so it is left unreleased, as it
//! was before this part: that exec is no longer running, and a frame or a
//! host object it handed the pointer to may still hold it borrowed. An owned
//! bit that is set implies the slot's `initialized` flag is set and that the
//! slot holds a reference the current exec stored.
//!
//! **The slot table.** A global is classified by the pointer its
//! [`StorageSlot`] carries, recorded when the globals are declared, never by
//! symbol name: `pyglobal_init_x` is a valid name for a user global
//! `init_x`'s value slot, and `Module::add_global` silently renames a
//! duplicate, so a name lookup can return the wrong global.
//!
//! **Frame slots** own their reference too since Part 2
//! ([#1502](https://github.com/rotnov/pycc/issues/1502)), through
//! `object_frame.rs` rather than this module: a frame slot is private to
//! one activation, so it needs neither the owned bit nor the activation
//! gate. A function-local name never resolves to a global's slot, because
//! a function cannot assign a global (`global` is refused with `C0001`), so
//! a local target always gets its own alloca. Compiled-instance `object`
//! attributes retain a borrowed source ([`retain_if_borrowed`] in the
//! `MirStmt::AttrSet` arm) but never release the replaced word; that slot
//! class is Part 4 ([#1504](https://github.com/rotnov/pycc/issues/1504)).

/// `pycc_ext_activation_exit` (or `_status`), around the `return` itself --
/// not in the watermark release -- so a wrapper stays counted until its
/// return value holds its own host reference and every cleanup that can run
/// a finalizer (the watermark release, a `PyBuffer_Release`) has finished. A
/// finalizer may switch the GIL; counted out before it, a suspended wrapper
/// would let a paused exec's rebind release the borrowed result it is about

/// code: a carrier's `__copy__` and `tp_dealloc` run only the runtime. It is

/// (`Python.h` rejects `Py_LIMITED_API` under `Py_GIL_DISABLED`) and at
/// import (the shim's `PyInit_` refuses an interpreter whose
/// `Py_GetVersion()` names a free-threading build).
///

/// lowering `global` (a function would then write the slot), generator
/// support (a suspended frame of the same activation could keep a borrowed
/// copy across a rebind), publishing object globals on the host module (the
