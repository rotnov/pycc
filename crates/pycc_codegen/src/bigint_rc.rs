/// ingress, so a tuple field holds a reference of its own; but
/// `MirExpr::Subscript`'s tuple branch hands the stored word straight back
/// out **without transferring** that reference, which stays with the
/// field. The reader therefore owns nothing and must take its own
/// reference -- which is what this arm does.
///
/// D-181 shipped this arm under the opposite premise (the field was a pure
/// alias, retaining nothing) and recorded the converse direction --
/// overwriting the supplying name before the tuple is read -- as a known,
/// unfixed use-after-free tracked by
/// [#633](https://github.com/rotnov/pycc/issues/633). D-182 closes that
/// direction by adding the ingress retain, and in doing so replaces the
/// arm's old **unenforced precondition** (sound only while the supplying
/// name is still bound) with a real reference. The classification itself
/// is unchanged; only its justification is.
///
/// Deliberately **not** shared with `int_value_is_a_duplicate_reference`
/// even though the two predicates agree on today's three borrowed shapes.
/// The two sides fail in opposite directions and must be free to diverge:
/// a missing retain here leaks, while a missing "borrowed" classification
/// on the release side frees a live word. Sharing one predicate would make
/// every future ownership refinement a simultaneous edit to both an
/// over-approximating and an under-approximating consumer.
///
/// The tuple arm is balanced at four of this helper's five call sites:
/// `MirStmt::Assign` is matched by the slot's own release-before-store,
/// `MirStmt::Return` is matched by the caller's D-181 release of the
/// `Call { ty: Int }` result, and the call-argument and `MirStmt::AttrSet`
/// sites are unmatched -- exactly D-180 residual 3's existing shape, not a
/// new leak class.
///
/// The fifth site, D-182's `MirExpr::TupleLiteral` ingress, is a
/// **deliberate** imbalance: nothing releases a `Ty::Tuple` slot's fields
/// when the slot is overwritten or dies, so a tuple's ingress reference is
/// never retired. That is a new leak class -- a rebound supplier inside a
/// loop leaks once per trip -- accepted knowingly under D-182 as the price
/// of closing the #633 direction-B use-after-free. Only a *borrowed*
/// element is retained: an owning element already arrives holding the one
/// reference the field will keep, and retaining it too would leave rc at 2
/// with a single owner, which a future `Ty::Tuple` slot-death release
/// under D-124's container refcounting could never balance.

    // -----------------------------------------------------------------
    // #624 (D-180) codegen-depth: the inline bigint-refcount guard.
    //
    // The behavioral tests for this feature live in
    // `tests/issue_146_bigint_release.rs` (real source through the real
    // CLI, plus two peak-RSS oracles). Those prove the *net effect* -- a
    // loop's peak RSS stops tracking its trip count -- but they cannot see
    // the two structural properties the emitter is actually responsible
    // for, because both are invisible in a program's output and in its RSS:
    //
    //   1. Every `pycc_rt_bigint_retain`/`_release` call is reached only
    //      through `emit_bigint_refcount_call`'s inline `(word & 0b11) == 0
    //      && word != 0` guard, on the *same* word the call receives. An
    //      unguarded call is correct-but-slow, so it regresses D-084/D-140's
    //      nbody throughput floor silently rather than failing a test.
    //   2. That guard splits the current basic block, so any caller
    //      recording a block for a phi incoming edge must re-read
    //      `get_insert_block()` afterwards. A stale phi predecessor is
    //      malformed IR that LLVM's own verifier rejects.
    //
    // These are in-crate rather than in `tests/` on purpose:
    // `compile_to_object_with_observer`, the only way to reach the emitted
    // module before it becomes an object file, is private -- so this
    // follows `an_oversized_int_literal_materializes_a_runtime_bigint` in
    // the crate root's own test module (`tests.rs`), which is this
    // repository's actual
    // IR-inspection convention, rather than
    // `tests/slice1_codegen_depth.rs`'s
    // hand-built-MIR-through-`compile_to_object` one.
    //
    // They live beside the emitter they exercise rather than in the crate
    // root's test module, under AGENTS.md's decomposability rule: this
    // cluster is
    // self-contained -- no test outside it uses `RefcountCall`,
    // `guarded_bigint_refcount_calls`, `refcount_calls_in` or `int_name` --
    // so it is exactly the cohesive unit that rule points at.
