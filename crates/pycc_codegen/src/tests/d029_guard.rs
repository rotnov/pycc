//! The D-029 mechanical guard's checking logic, split into its own
//! cohesion-driven submodule under AGENTS.md's decomposability rule
//! ("a Rust source file over ~1,000 lines is a maintainability and
//! agent-context risk ... decompose the part it touches into
//! cohesion-driven submodules as part of that same change"). #619
//! touched `tests.rs` (already far past that threshold) to extract this
//! guard's checks into a reusable function and add automated coverage
//! for it; this file is that extraction's home instead of growing the
//! parent file further.
//!
//! `tests.rs`'s own
//! `every_inkwell_llvm_string_call_routes_through_a_d029_wrapper` test
//! stays in the parent file (it belongs with this crate's other
//! `#[test]` functions and is the one thing every contributor actually
//! runs), and calls into [`d029_violations`] here.

/// The three D-029 checks that
/// `super::every_inkwell_llvm_string_call_routes_through_a_d029_wrapper`
/// runs against the crate's real sources, extracted so this module's own
/// tests can drive the identical logic against synthetic sources
/// instead.
///
/// `sources` is `(path, contents)` pairs, matching what a directory scan
/// yields; the path is accepted but not currently used by any check
/// (kept for parity with the real scan and for messages a future check
/// might want to name a file in). `expected_triple_call_sites` is the
/// tripwire target for check 3 below -- the real caller passes the
/// crate's current count (2); a synthetic fixture passes whatever count
/// its own snippet actually contains, since the tripwire is inherently
/// tied to how many call sites exist in whatever source it is pointed
/// at, not a universal constant.
///
/// Pure and panic-free: it returns one message per violated check
/// (empty when `sources` fully complies) rather than asserting, so a
/// caller -- the real test in the parent module, or a synthetic
/// negative test below -- decides what a violation means for it.
///
/// D-029 records three distinct protections, and this function checks
/// them to three different depths -- state that plainly rather than
/// letting the function's name imply uniform coverage:
///
///  1. `llvm_string_to_owned`, which forgets the wrapper instead of
///     dropping it. Fully checked: every `print_to_string` call must
///     name it on the same line.
///  2. `verify_module`, a no-op under `#[cfg(windows)]`. Fully checked:
///     exactly one direct `verify` call may exist, the wrapper's own.
///  3. `ManuallyDrop` at the point a `TargetTriple` is created, which
///     covers every exit path including the early `?`. Only tripwired:
///     the wrapping is structural and spans several lines, so a
///     line-oriented scan cannot confirm it. What it can do is pin the
///     number of triple-producing call sites, so adding one without
///     raising `expected_triple_call_sites` is flagged as a violation.
///
/// `Target::from_triple`'s and `write_to_file`'s `.map_err` sites fall
/// under (1) and are checked only insofar as they name the wrapper.
///
/// The needles are assembled at run time (`format!` over split
/// fragments, never a literal like `.print_to_string()`) so that this
/// function's own source, and any fixture string a caller builds the
/// same way, is never mistaken for a violation of itself -- important
/// specifically because the real caller in the parent module scans this
/// whole crate's `src/` directory, which now includes this file too.
