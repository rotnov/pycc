//! `None` returned from a function whose declared return type is the
//! opaque CPython `object` (#1387, D-258's return-position amendment).
//!
//! `pycc_types` admits exactly two spellings into an `object` return slot
//! that would otherwise be `T0022`: a bare `return` and `return None` (the
//! literal). Both must hand the caller CPython's `None`, but the MIR carries
//! them as `MirStmt::Return(None)` and `MirStmt::Return(Some(NoneLiteral))`,
//! and neither generic path produces a `PyObject *`: the bare form emits the
//! type's zero default (a null pointer, which the export wrapper reports as
//! `SystemError`), and `NoneLiteral` emits the native `Optional` carrier.
//!
//! [`object_return_value`] folds the bare form into the literal one, and
//! since Part 2 of #1387 the `return` path boxes every native returned value
//! -- the `None` literal included -- through `object_box`, which turns the
//! literal into [`crate::foreign_pack::none_pointer`]'s borrowed `Py_None`.
//! Since #1502 an `object` return is a new reference the caller owns, so
//! the `return` path retains that borrowed `Py_None`
//! (`object_frame::owned_return`), exactly as it retains an object
//! parameter returned by name; the export wrapper's `pycc_ext_pack_object`
//! hands that reference to the host unchanged.
