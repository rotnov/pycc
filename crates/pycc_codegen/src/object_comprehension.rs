//! A list or set comprehension over a CPython object (Part 1 of #1255):
//! `[elt for x in <object> if cond]` and `{elt for x in <object> if cond}`,
//! producing a fresh CPython `list` or `set` (`Ty::Object`, D-258).
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! The iterable is evaluated once in the enclosing scope, then iterated
//! through the same two halves `for x in <object>:` uses
//! ([`foreign_call::emit_get_iter`] and [`foreign_call::emit_iter_header`]).
//! The result collection is created *after* `iter()` succeeds, as CPython's
//! own comprehension does, so a non-iterable source raises before anything
//! else happens. Each element is packed across the boundary and handed to
//! [`EXT_OBJ_COLLECT_SYMBOL`], which consumes it on every path.
//!
//! Every failure -- `iter()`, `next()`, the result constructor, the
//! condition's truth test, the element's own evaluation, packing, and the
//! insertion itself (an unhashable set item) -- takes the current function's
//! foreign failure edge ([`ForeignFailEdge::for_current`]): the
//! `EXT_MODULE_EXEC_FAILED` return in the module body outside every
//! module-level `try`, and otherwise the error bridge plus the enclosing
//! handler (Part 1 of #1096).
//!
//! # Ownership
//!
//! A produced source (`[e for e in s.items]`) is released right after
//! `iter()` has taken its own reference (Part 1 of #1092). The iterator and
//! the result collection are held on `pending_object_releases` from the
//! moment each exists (Part 3 of #1092), so every failure edge below
//! releases both; the normal exit releases the iterator and hands the
//! result on as the node's value, which `object_release::is_produced`
//! lists as a producer, so an unbound result is released by its consumer.
//! Each item is `pycc_ext_obj_iter_next`'s new reference, owned by its own
//! trip (Part 3 of #1499): it is held on `pending_object_releases` from the
//! moment it is stored into the loop variable's scoped slot, so a failure
//! in the condition, the element, packing or the insertion releases it, and
//! both ways a trip continues -- a false condition and a collected element
//! -- branch through one `objcomp_trip_end` block that releases it before
//! the next `next()`. No item is held when `next()` itself runs, so its
//! failure edge and the loop's exit release none. The slot keeps the
//! released pointer only until the next trip's store overwrites it: the
//! variable is visible in the comprehension alone (`comprehension.rs`), and
//! nothing reads it outside a trip. Releasing at the trip's end is sound
//! because nothing the trip runs can keep the item borrowed past it: the
//! packer and every foreign operation take references of their own, a
//! compiled-instance `object` attribute store retains a borrowed value
//! (Part 1 of #1499), a compiled function cannot rebind a module global
//! (`global` is refused with `C0001`), a walrus inside a comprehension --
//! which would bind the item to a name outliving the trip -- is refused by
//! `pycc_hir`, and a user function's frame -- the only other place a
//! borrowed copy can live -- has returned before the trip ends. Admitting
//! either refused form must revisit this release.
//! A pycc `int` temporary built by the condition or the element is released
//! once it has been tested or packed, since the packers borrow their operand,
//! and so is a produced CPython object condition or element (`if x.ok()`,
//! `x.a for ...`, Part 1 of #1092): the condition is held across its truth
//! test, and the element is released once the packer has taken a reference
//! of its own.
