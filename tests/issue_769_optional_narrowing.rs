// Issue #769 (Part 2 of #747), D-199: flow-sensitive `Optional[int]`
// narrowing on `is None` / `is not None`. `tests/fixtures/pep_0604_union.py`
// exercises the same feature through `tests/conformance.rs`'s CPython
// byte-for-byte oracle comparison, but that comparison is skipped whenever
// the pinned `python3.14` oracle is unavailable on `PATH` (see
// `conformance.rs`'s `oracle_python_bin`). This file gives the bigint-payload
// narrowed-read scenario an oracle-independent, self-contained regression
// test so it is exercised (and its codegen path covered) even in an
// environment without that pinned CPython build installed.
//
// Specifically: assigning a narrowed `Optional[int]` read into a second
// binding forces codegen's duplicate-reference retain path
// (`pycc_codegen::bigint_rc::retain_if_int_duplicate`) to run on a
// `MirExpr::OptionalUnwrap` source rather than a plain `int` source -- the
// scenario is only reachable when the unwrapped payload is a heap-allocated
// bigint (2**62 and above), since a smallint payload never reaches that
// function's `Scalar::Int` guard at all.
