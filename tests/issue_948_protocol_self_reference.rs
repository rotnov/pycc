//! #948 (PEP 544): a protocol member whose annotation names its own protocol.
//!
//! `class P(Protocol): def clone(self) -> P: ...` used to lower to
//! `Ty::Instance("P")` rather than `Ty::Protocol("P")`, because
//! `pycc_hir::func::annotation_to_ty`'s self-reference arms ran before the
//! `class_defs` lookup that resolves a protocol name. Every concrete class
//! implementing `clone` was then rejected with a spurious `T0046` (return type
//! mismatch) rendered at the module's first line, even when its `clone`
//! returned a conforming instance. The PEP 673 spelling (`-> Self`) had the
//! same defect and compiled silently when no conforming class was present.
//!
//! Both spellings now resolve through `func::enclosing_class_ty` to
//! `Ty::Protocol("P")` and reach #934's existing `C0001` protocol-return gate,
//! on the annotation's own span and with #934's own message -- the issue's
//! second stated outcome ("the self-reference is rejected with a real `C0001`
//! naming the construct"). The first ("structural conformance accepts `-> C`")
//! is not reachable at this scale: `pycc_types::class::
//! check_protocol_conformance` compares member signatures with plain
//! `is_assignable` and does no structural matching, so even a cross-class
//! `other: D` against a member `other: Q` is `T0046` today.
//!
//! The *parameter* position is not gated -- `Ty::Protocol` is supported there
//! (D-166) -- so a protocol member declared `def same(self, other: P) -> bool`
//! and a conforming class spelling the parameter the same way now compile and
//! run. Before this fix that program failed with the self-contradictory
//! `T0046: ... parameter 1 has type `P`, expected `P``, one side
//! `Ty::Protocol("P")` and the other `Ty::Instance("P")`.
//!
//! Unit tests beside the gate (`pycc_hir::class::protocol_return_tests`) pin
//! the lowered `Ty` for every member position; these prove the binary reports
//! the diagnostic (exit 1, never the 101 a panic exits with) and that the
//! accepted shape runs.
