//! Issue #638 (D-208): public-CLI coverage for releasing a heap-bigint's
//! birth reference on the D-173 exception-unwinding edge.
//!
//! D-181 (#625) closed the normal-path leak of a nested `int` arithmetic
//! temporary but left two residual leak flavors, both closed by this issue:
//!
//! 1. A multi-child MIR node (`BinOp`, `Compare`, a `range()` preheader)
//!    whose earlier child already produced an owned `int` word, and whose
//!    later child's evaluation raises before the parent's own release call
//!    is textually reached. `guard_statement_effects` branches away to the
//!    installed exception target before that release call runs, orphaning
//!    the earlier operand's reference -- one leaked `BigIntObj` per raise.
//! 2. A multi-argument `Call`/`Instantiate` site, where a fresh argument's
//!    ownership is meant to *transfer* to the callee rather than being
//!    released at all -- if a later argument's evaluation raises before the
//!    call is reached, the transfer never happens and the earlier argument's
//!    reference is orphaned the same way. `MirExpr::TupleLiteral`'s own
//!    element-evaluation loop is this same "ownership transfer" flavor: a
//!    fresh element's word is meant to transfer into the aggregate's own
//!    field via `build_insert_value` rather than being released, so a later
//!    sibling element's raising evaluation orphans an earlier element's
//!    reference the identical way a later call argument's raise orphans an
//!    earlier one.
//!
//! Follows `tests/issue_146_bigint_release.rs`'s own `peak_rss` module
//! convention (duplicated helpers, per that file's own stated rationale)
//! rather than sharing a helper crate.

// Peak-RSS marginal comparison: the leak is invisible to every value
// assertion above -- releasing an object one iteration late (or never) does
// not corrupt any value this program prints, only its memory footprint.
//
// A naive single-vs-double-iteration RSS *ratio* (the convention
// `tests/issue_146_bigint_release.rs`'s own `peak_rss` module uses) is
// blind here: every repro below raises and catches `ZeroDivisionError` on
// *every* trip, and `crates/pycc_rt/src/exception.rs` documents that
// exception-object lifetime management is "intentionally leak-only in this
// first implementation" -- `pycc_rt_exception_clear` never frees the
// `PyExceptionObj` (or its message) that `pycc_rt_exception_alloc` built.
// That pre-existing, already-accepted, out-of-#638-scope leak scales
// linearly with the raise count on *both* a correctly-fixed and a
// still-buggy binary, so a plain ratio against a `< 1.35` threshold would
// fail unconditionally regardless of whether this issue's fix works --
// confirmed empirically: with the D-208 codegen changes applied, the
// straight single-vs-double ratio of the binop repro alone is still
// ~1.947 (250k -> 38,125,568 bytes; 500k -> 74,235,904 bytes), because the
// ratio measures the exception-object leak, not the bigint leak.
//
// Each test below instead compares the *marginal* RSS growth (250k -> 500k
// iterations) of the leak-shape repro against a same-exception-rate control
// repro that never allocates the fresh temporary this issue is about (its
// exception-side operand is a plain `Name` read, D-181's own
// "duplicate reference" case, not a birth reference). Both repros raise
// exactly once per trip, so both marginals include one exception-object
// leak per iteration; the control's marginal is therefore the calibration
// the plain ratio is missing: the leak rate contributed by the
// pre-existing, accepted exception-object model alone. Measured directly:
// with the D-208 fix applied, `leak_marginal / control_marginal` is
// ~0.9995 for all three flavors (the two marginals track each other almost
// exactly); reverting the fix alone (keeping this test's own repro shapes)
// widens it to ~1.333 (one extra `BigIntObj` release's worth of marginal
// growth per iteration). `< 1.15` sits with a comfortable margin on both
// sides of that gap.
