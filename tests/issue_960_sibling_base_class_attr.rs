//! Issue #960: a sibling MRO base's class attribute no longer shadows another
//! base's instance slot, end to end through the public `pycc` CLI.
//!
//! `pycc_hir`'s `reject_class_attr_collisions` walks only a class's *own*
//! `class_attrs` against its own MRO, so two independent sibling bases -- one
//! establishing an instance slot in `__init__`, the other declaring a
//! same-named class attribute -- are never compared with each other. That
//! shape is legal and `pycc_types::class::resolve_attr_get` already resolves
//! it CPython's way (an instance `__dict__` entry shadows a
//! non-data-descriptor class attribute), but `pycc_mir`'s instance `AttrGet`
//! arm folded the class attribute *before* looking for the slot. The result
//! was a silently wrong value, and -- when the two declared types differ -- a
//! `pycc_codegen` abort, because the checker and the lowering disagreed about
//! the read's type.
//!
//! Every accepting test asserts the program's *stdout*, never a bare exit 0:
//! the whole defect was a wrong value from a program that compiled fine.
//! Rejections are matched on the diagnostic code plus a message substring
//! rather than on a rendered path, which prints with forward slashes on
//! Windows CI.
