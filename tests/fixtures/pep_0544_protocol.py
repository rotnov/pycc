# PEP 544 (#380): Protocols and structural typing.
#
# Exercises: a @runtime_checkable protocol with a method requirement,
# two conforming concrete classes, a non-conforming class, protocol-typed
# variable assignments with method calls, isinstance against the
# runtime_checkable protocol (True for conforming, False for
# non-conforming), and a protocol-typed function parameter.
#
# Both pycc and CPython 3.14.6 produce identical stdout: the protocol is
# a compile-time-only interface in pycc and a deferred-annotation type
# hint in CPython, so neither emits anything for the protocol definition
# itself — only the concrete class method calls and isinstance results
# produce observable output, and those match byte-for-byte.
