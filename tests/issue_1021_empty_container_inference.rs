// Issue #1021 (D-245): an empty `[]` / `{}` gets its element type from a
// pre-check HIR-to-HIR pass, end to end through the real `pycc build` /
// `pycc check` CLI -- parser -> hir -> types -> mir -> codegen -> link -> run.
//
// Every positive case below is built and *run*, because the element type has
// to survive into MIR: `MirExpr::ty()` derives a container's type from its
// first element and panics on an empty literal, so a resolution that stopped
// at `pycc_types` would type-check and then abort the compiler. The negative
// and unresolved cases live in `tests/diagnostics/t0003_*` and
// `tests/diagnostics/t003{4,6}_inferred_*`.
//
// Every expected stdout below was verified against CPython 3.14 on the same
// source.
