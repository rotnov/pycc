//! #1445: `s = []` beside an object binding `s = value_stack[-size:]` whose
//! slice bound derives from a name bound inside a `try` suite -- lark
//! `lalr_parser_state.py`'s `feed_token`, lines 74-99 (`action, arg = ...`
//! inside `try`/`except KeyError`, `size = len(rule.expansion)`, then the
//! two bindings of `s`).
//!
//! Part 2d of #1371 already types such an `s = []` as a fresh CPython
//! `list` (D-258's Part 2d amendment, source (b)). What was missing is the
//! evidence: the flat whole-function binder the empty-container pass reads
//! had no `try` arm, so `arg`, `size` and the slice never typed and `s`
//! was never bound to the object. Every hosted test builds the source with
//! `pycc build --ext`, imports the artifact into the host CPython, and
//! compares its output with CPython's own run of the same source. The
//! hosted tests are `#[ignore]`d and contribute no line coverage; the
//! Tier-1 `native-build-test` leg runs them with
//! `cargo test --workspace -- --include-ignored`. The changed lines are
//! covered in-process by
//! `crates/pycc_types/src/tests/generic_monomorphization_arms.rs` and
//! `crates/pycc_types/src/foreign/list_display/tests.rs`.
