//! Issue #974: a class-name-qualified read of an *inherited* class attribute
//! (`Derived.LIMIT`, where a base declares `LIMIT`) resolves, end to end
//! through the public `pycc` CLI.
//!
//! Before the fix, `pycc_types`' class-name read looked only at the named
//! class's *own* `class_attrs` and rejected anything else with `T0044`, so
//! `B.LIMIT` failed while `b.LIMIT` -- which already walked the MRO --
//! succeeded. CPython accepts both.
//!
//! Two properties beyond "it now compiles" are pinned here, because the two
//! obvious fixes are each wrong in their own way:
//!
//! - The read must **not** reuse the instance path's #960 precedence. A class
//!   object has no instance `__dict__`, so an instance slot contributed by an
//!   earlier MRO base does not shadow a later base's class attribute. CPython
//!   agrees, and the divergence test below pins both halves of the pair in one
//!   program: `c.x` is `1` and `C.x` is `2`.
//! - The read must **not** walk `class_attrs` alone either. A derived class
//!   that re-declares an inherited attribute's name as a method, static
//!   method, class method or property shadows the base's class attribute in
//!   CPython; folding the base's constant there would turn today's spurious
//!   `T0044` into a silently wrong value. The four shadow tests pin that the
//!   bare read stays `T0044`, and the paired call test pins that the
//!   `@staticmethod` shape still compiles and still prints its own answer.
//!
//! Every accepting test asserts the program's *stdout*, never a bare exit 0:
//! the risk this change carries is a wrong constant, not a failed build.
//! Rejections are matched on the diagnostic code plus a message substring
//! rather than on a rendered path, which prints with forward slashes on
//! Windows CI. Every expected value below was measured against CPython 3.13.
