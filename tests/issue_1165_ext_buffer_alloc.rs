//! Part 2a of #1142 (#1165): artifact-owned buffer storage, exercised end
//! to end through the real `pycc build --ext` CLI and a hosted CPython run.
//!
//! Every `Ty::MemoryView` before this part was a view the generated wrapper
//! borrowed from the host for the duration of one call. `a = ndarray(n)`
//! adds the second provenance: storage the artifact allocates, uses, and
//! frees inside the allocating frame, with nothing able to carry it out.
//!
//! This file owns the halves no in-crate unit test can reach:
//!
//! * the diagnostics a real program gets when the producer appears anywhere
//!   but an assignment's right-hand side, at module scope, or with a
//!   non-`int` length;
//! * the native-mode refusal, which is a property of the artifact mode and
//!   so needs the driver rather than a crate;
//! * the hosted arms that prove a compiled allocation is real memory the
//!   compiled code can store into and read back;
//! * and the leak arm, which reads `pycc_rt_buffer_live_views` -- the
//!   allocator pair's own balance counter -- out of the built extension
//!   module with `ctypes` and asserts it is back at zero after every call.
//! * the two refused-length arms, which are the observations that can only
//!   be made from a *hosted* run: a length that aborts and a length that
//!   raises both print to stderr, so only the host process's own exit
//!   status tells them apart (134 against 0);
//! * and the leak arm, whose bullet continues below.
//!   The library is opened by `alloc_probe.__file__`, the sibling
//!   `issue_1054_ext_str_release.rs` probe's convention, so the handle
//!   refers to the same mapping the import created. That arm is the one
//!   thing here that is **not** compiled on Windows, for the reason that
//!   file states in full: MSVC exports from a `.pyd` only the single
//!   `PyInit_<name>` a D-244 `ext` module declares, so a counter linked in
//!   from the `pycc_rt` static archive is present but unreachable through
//!   `ctypes`. Every other arm, diagnostics included, runs on Windows.
//!   That symbol is reachable because `pycc_rt` links into the module as a
//!   staticlib; asserting on it is what distinguishes "the epilogue ran"
//!   from "the process had enough memory not to notice". Its last arm is
//!   the only place a *live* allocation leaves through the exception exit.
//!
//! Every non-`#[ignore]`d test here asserts a front-end diagnostic, and
//! deliberately so: a successful `--ext` build needs CPython development
//! headers at or above the `Py_LIMITED_API` floor, which CI's coverage job
//! does not have when it runs. See
//! `a_program_that_defines_the_spelling_keeps_its_own_meaning` for the one
//! property that had to be restated as a refusal to keep it in that pass.
//!
//! None of these contributes line coverage: CI's coverage job runs
//! `llvm-cov` without `--include-ignored` and `scripts/check_diff_coverage.py`
//! excludes `tests/` from its denominator either way.

/// #1166 round 8's P1, corroborated on a real artifact: neither door out of
/// the `ndarray(n)` length aborts the host interpreter any more.
///
/// Two distinct defects shared this arm, and the exit status is what found
/// the second one.
///
/// 1. A **bigint** length was decoded by `pycc_rt_int_untag_checked`, which
///    `panic!`s on a bigint word; a panic unwinding past a plain
///    `extern "C" fn` boundary is caught there and turned into a process
///    abort, and for a D-244 `ext` artifact that process is the host CPython
///    interpreter. `sized(2 ** 62 - 1)` exited **134**, with
///    `pycc_rt_int_untag_checked` on the backtrace. Reachable only by
///    promotion (`n + 1`), since the wrapper rejects a bigint *argument*
///    first -- hence the separate subject.
/// 2. An **oversized inline** length needs no bigint at all:
///    `build_and_sum(2 ** 62 - 1)` decoded cleanly and then overflowed
///    `Vec`'s capacity inside `pycc_rt_buffer_f64_alloc`, whose `panic!` the
///    same boundary turned into the same abort. Also measured at 134.
///
/// The exit status is the load-bearing assertion in both arms. An aborting
/// process prints its panic text to stderr, so a stderr-content check alone
/// passes on the defect as well as on the fix; only the status separates
/// them. Each arm additionally asserts that an in-range length still returns
/// its value, so a fix that refused everything could not pass either.
