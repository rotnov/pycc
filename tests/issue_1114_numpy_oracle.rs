//! Part 3 of #1027 (#1114): the numpy oracle -- a real third-party array
//! reaching the compiled buffer path, checked against CPython.
//!
//! Part 1 (#1112) admitted `memoryview` in an `--ext` signature and Part 2
//! (#1113) added the one bounds-checked element load. Both proved the
//! seam against `array.array`, a buffer this repository creates itself.
//! What this part adds is the first subject whose data comes from a
//! library pycc knows nothing about: `numpy.ndarray`, reaching the
//! admitted slot as `memoryview(a.reshape(-1))` -- a zero-copy, 1-D,
//! C-contiguous, format `'d'` view.
//!
//! #1129 widened the boundary's first refusal arm from `PyMemoryView_Check`
//! to `PyObject_CheckBuffer`, so the same array now also reaches the slot
//! **bare**, with no `memoryview(...)` around it. This file carries both
//! halves of that: the bare array agrees with the view element for element
//! in the oracle below, and the refusal arms it moved off are re-pinned
//! where they land now.
//!
//! D-244 rule 7 closes the type boundary at the thunk export seam, so the
//! interesting half is symmetric: the conforming view must agree with
//! CPython element for element, and every *non*-conforming numpy argument
//! must be refused by pycc's own authored text rather than read wrong.
//!
//! The subject takes the row count `n` as a parameter because `len(b)` is
//! not yet a capability (#1116, a `C0001` gap). That is a consequence of
//! the gap, not a requirement of the oracle: when #1116 lands, these
//! functions keep compiling and this file needs no change.
//!
//! The hosted arms below need numpy importable by the same interpreter
//! that `pycc build --ext` links against. On CI that is supplied by the
//! `native-build-test` job's "Install numpy into the hosted ext floor
//! interpreter" step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; without it these
//! tests skip and this file asserts nothing. `build-test-coverage` has no
//! such step and is expected to skip.
//!
//! None of these contributes line coverage: CI's coverage job runs
//! `llvm-cov` without `--include-ignored` and `scripts/check_diff_coverage.py`
//! excludes `tests/` from its denominator either way.
