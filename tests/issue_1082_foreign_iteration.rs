//! Part 3 of #1026 (PR 3c of #1082): `for` iteration over a CPython
//! object.
//!
//! `tests/issue_1080_foreign_object.rs` owns what a foreign `import`
//! binds and the refusal table around it;
//! `tests/issue_1081_foreign_method_call.rs` owns the method call,
//! `tests/issue_1082_foreign_len_and_truth.rs` owns `len` and truth
//! testing and `tests/issue_1082_foreign_subscript.rs` owns the subscript
//! load. This file owns the one operation PR 3c adds: `for x in o.attr:`
//! and `for x in o.method(...):`, the two iterable shapes admitted.
//!
//! The non-ignored tests here stop at `pycc check`, so they need no
//! CPython on `PATH`. The `#[ignore]`d hosted tests at the bottom
//! contribute no line coverage (CI's coverage job runs `llvm-cov` without
//! `--include-ignored`); every new Rust line is covered by the unit tests
//! in `crates/pycc_types/src/foreign/tests.rs`,
//! `crates/pycc_mir/src/tests/import.rs` and
//! `crates/pycc_codegen/src/foreign_call.rs`.
