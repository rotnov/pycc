//! Part 1 of #1175 (#1178): returning the name a `memoryview` **parameter**
//! binds, from a public `pycc build --ext` export.
//!
//! Part 2b of #1142 ([#1164](https://github.com/rotnov/pycc/issues/1164))
//! admitted exactly one provenance at a buffer return -- storage the
//! artifact itself allocated with `a = ndarray(n)`, whose exporter's
//! `tp_dealloc` frees it -- and #1174 extended that to a public method. A
//! *parameter*-bound name was refused, and the stated reason was that the
//! wrapper releases the host's `Py_buffer` on the way out, so handing the
//! view back would be a use-after-free.
//!
//! That reason is false, and this file is where the correction is proven
//! rather than argued. The wrapper acquires a **second, independent buffer
//! export** on the host's own argument object with
//! `PyMemoryView_FromObject` *before* it releases its own `Py_buffer`. An
//! export -- not a reference -- is what pins an exporter's storage, so the
//! returned view spans storage the caller's object still owns and pycc
//! frees nothing: `pycc_rt_buffer_live_views` is zero for the whole call.
//!
//! Two host-side assertions carry the substance and no front-end test can
//! make either:
//!
//! * the host's own `array.array('d').extend(...)` raises `BufferError`
//!   while the returned view is alive and succeeds once it is released --
//!   the storage really is pinned, and a later "optimization" that replaced
//!   the packer with a `Py_INCREF` would fail here and nowhere else;
//! * a PEP 688 Python-level exporter logs `__buffer__` / `__release_buffer__`
//!   in the order the wrapper actually calls them. That is the *only*
//!   subject that discriminates acquire-before-release from
//!   release-before-acquire: an `array.array('d')` is a pure C exporter and
//!   its acquire/release are unobservable from Python.
//!
//! #1178's scope boundary is the **bare** parameter name. `return b[1:3]`
//! is Part 2 (#1179) and `return g(b)` for a buffer-returning `g` stays
//! refused by #1175's own scope boundary; both are pinned below so a later
//! widening has to delete an assertion deliberately.
