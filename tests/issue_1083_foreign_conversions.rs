//! Part 4 of #1026: the scalar conversions out of a CPython object --
//! `float(o)` and `bool(o)` (PR 4a of #1083), `int(o)` and `str(o)`
//! (PR 4b).
//!
//! `tests/issue_1080_foreign_object.rs` owns what a foreign `import` binds
//! and the refusal table around it; `tests/issue_1081_foreign_method_call.rs`
//! owns the method call; `tests/issue_1082_foreign_len_and_truth.rs` owns
//! `len`, truth testing, the subscript load and `for` iteration. This file
//! owns the four conversions.
//!
//! **These are explicit conversions, not implicit boundary crossings.**
//! D-244 rule 7 keeps the type boundary closed at the *thunk export seam*,
//! where a value crosses implicitly and its annotation is the whole
//! contract. `float(o)` in user source names its destination type, so
//! running CPython's own conversion protocol (`PyNumber_Float`,
//! `PyObject_IsTrue`, `PyNumber_Long`, `PyObject_Str`) is exactly what the
//! author asked for. `docs/TYPE_SYSTEM.md`'s `object` row carries the same
//! paragraph.
//!
//! **The relaxation is `Ty::Object`-only, and the residual incoherence is
//! stated rather than hidden.** `bool(o)` and `str(o)` compile while
//! `bool(1)` and `str(1)` keep their `C0001`; #1017/#1018 own the general
//! builtin-conversion story. Every other argument type reaches the unchanged
//! refusal, which the tests below pin in both directions.
//!
//! PR 4b's own two consequences are pinned here as well: `print(str(o))`
//! type-checks (the `str` the shim copies out of CPython is an ordinary pycc
//! `str`, so `string_conversion.rs` needs nothing for it; `print(o)` itself
//! is admitted too since #1340), and `int(o)` refuses a value outside the D-141
//! inline-integer range with `OverflowError` rather than growing a bigint
//! path (#1040).
//!
//! The hosted tests contribute no line coverage (CI's coverage job runs
//! `llvm-cov` without `--include-ignored`); they are run by the Tier-1
//! `native-build-test` leg's `cargo test --workspace -- --include-ignored`.
//! Every new Rust line is covered by the non-ignored tests here, by
//! `crates/pycc_codegen/src/foreign_len.rs`'s IR assertions, and by the unit
//! tests in `crates/pycc_types` and `crates/pycc_mir`.
