//! #1134: the bare name `NDArray` as a third source spelling of the `ext`
//! boundary's buffer carrier.
//!
//! The capitalized `numpy.typing` spelling is what 18 of the 19
//! array-parameter occurrences in the #1039 census actually write, so it is
//! the spelling a reader of that census meets first. It is registered on
//! exactly the terms `ndarray` was (#1129): one line in
//! `annotation_to_ty`'s `Expr::Name` arm, resolved *after* `class_defs` and
//! the alias table, lowering to `Ty::MemoryView` with no new `Ty` variant,
//! no new refusal arm and no new diagnostic family.
//!
//! **What this does not do, stated here so the file cannot be read as more
//! than it is:** it makes none of those 19 occurrences compile. Every one of
//! them also needs a name binding that does not exist yet — `from
//! numpy.typing import NDArray` is refused by the *foreign-import* path,
//! `import numpy as np` is #883, and an attribute-form base `np.ndarray` is
//! #889. Registering the name is necessary, not sufficient, and no
//! numerator in the census moves.
//!
//! Scope, against the two predecessors. The run-time half — the widened
//! `PyObject_CheckBuffer` admission predicate and the four wrapper arms — is
//! #1129's and is keyed on the resolved `Ty::MemoryView`, not on any
//! spelling, so it is reached identically here and is not restated: its
//! hosted, interpreter-loading evidence lives in
//! `tests/issue_1129_ndarray_buffer_carrier.rs`. The *subscripted* form is
//! #1130's, admitted by the resolved type alone, and
//! `tests/issue_1130_subscripted_annotations.rs`'s
//! `every_way_of_naming_the_buffer_carrier_is_subscriptable` carries
//! `NDArray` as its witness that a further spelling needs no edit there.
//! What is left for this file is the registration itself, its precedence,
//! and the refusals it inherits — every one of which resolves on the
//! program before `plan_ext` probes the host toolchain, so no test here is
//! `#[ignore]`d and all of them run inside the coverage job.
