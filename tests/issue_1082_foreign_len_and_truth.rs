//! Part 3 of #1026 (PR 3a of #1082): `len` and truth testing on a CPython
//! object.
//!
//! `tests/issue_1080_foreign_object.rs` owns what a foreign `import` binds
//! and the refusal table around it; `tests/issue_1081_foreign_method_call.rs`
//! owns the method call. This file owns the two operations PR 3a adds: that
//! each of the five condition-position shapes now type-checks (the ten
//! `reject_object_condition` sites are gone), that `len(o)` type-checks to
//! `int`, that PR 2a's positional bound is inherited unchanged by both, and
//! -- in the `#[ignore]`d hosted tests at the bottom -- that a real CPython
//! interpreter observes the right length, the right truth value, and the
//! right exception on each of the two failing calls (`PyObject_Size` and
//! `PyObject_IsTrue`).
//!
//! The hosted tests contribute no line coverage (CI's coverage job runs
//! `llvm-cov` without `--include-ignored`); they are run by the Tier-1
//! `native-build-test` leg's `cargo test --workspace -- --include-ignored`.
//! Every new Rust line is covered by the non-ignored tests here and by the
//! unit tests in `crates/pycc_codegen/src/foreign_len.rs`, which assert the
//! emitted IR for all five condition sites and both failure edges without
//! needing a CPython on `PATH`.
//!
//! One further hosted test, `a_shadowing_len_definition_still_builds_in_the_host`,
//! pins that a module-level `def len` does not divert `len(<object>)` away
//! from the `MirExpr::ObjLen` lowering and into a codegen panic. Its
//! non-ignored counterpart -- the line coverage for that fix -- is
//! `pycc_mir`'s `len_of_a_foreign_object_ignores_a_module_level_len_definition`.
