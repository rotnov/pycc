//! Part 1 of #1026 (PR 1c of #1080): what a CPython `import` binds, and what
//! the compiler refuses to do with it.
//!
//! Three separable claims live here, and they are kept together because they
//! are the same user-visible story told at three levels:
//!
//! * `pycc check` *accepts* a plain foreign import -- it is a frontend-only
//!   pass (`docs/CLI_SPEC.md`) with no `--ext` flag to judge against, so a
//!   bound-but-unused module object is not an error there;
//! * a plain `pycc build` refuses an import it cannot embed with `I0403`
//!   -- here `tkinter`, which needs Tcl/Tk from outside the interpreter
//!   (D-248 rule 1); a standard-library import builds embedded instead
//!   (`tests/issue_1223_embedded_executable.rs`), and a third-party root
//!   such as `numpy` is bundled from `pycc.lock` or refused there, naming
//!   `pycc lock` (`tests/issue_1242_locked_closure.rs`);
//! * every operation on the bound name other than an attribute load is
//!   refused, and all but one of them with `I0404`. Part 2 of #1026 (#1081)
//!   changed *where* that refusal is decided -- from the read of the
//!   binding to each consuming site, so `numpy.pi` itself could be admitted
//!   -- but not which programs it refuses, which is why every row of the
//!   table below still holds. `crates/pycc_types/src/foreign.rs` documents
//!   the migration. PR 2a's review then bounded the admitted set by
//!   *position* as well: a read of a foreign object is admitted only in a
//!   module body, never inside a function body, and never above the
//!   `import` itself -- both were compile errors before this change and
//!   both had become run-time traps. The one exception is a general method
//!   call (`numpy.sqrt(2.0)`), which PR 2a refused as `T0043` rather than
//!   `I0404` because it added no `Ty::Object` branch ahead of
//!   `class::resolve_method_call`. **PR 2b of #1081 admits that shape**: the
//!   branch exists now and answers `Ty::Object`, so the program type-checks
//!   (`a_general_method_call_on_a_foreign_object_is_accepted`).
//!   `tests/issue_1081_foreign_method_call.rs` owns the rest of that
//!   capability -- what it refuses, and what it does in a real host.
//!
//! The hosted tests at the bottom are `#[ignore]`d and contribute no line
//! coverage (CI's coverage job runs `llvm-cov` without `--include-ignored`);
//! they are run by the Tier-1 `native-build-test` leg's
//! `cargo test --workspace -- --include-ignored`. Everything this change
//! needs *covered* is covered by the non-ignored tests above them and by the
//! unit tests in `src/foreign_import.rs`,
//! `crates/pycc_codegen/src/foreign_import.rs` and
//! `crates/pycc_types/src/foreign/tests.rs`.
