//! Issue #146 Part 1: public-CLI coverage for heap-bigint refcounting at
//! named-storage and loop-induction sites.
//!
//! D-058 originally leaked every `BigIntObj` forever. #147 (D-179) widened
//! that leak to one object per `range` iteration, which is what makes it
//! observable as unbounded process growth rather than a bounded overflow-path
//! concession. Part 1 gives `BigIntObj` a refcount and releases it at the two
//! site families where a *named* storage location stops referring to a word:
//! ordinary assignment targets and `for`/comprehension induction variables.
//!
//! Two families live here:
//!
//! * **Value correctness under release.** Every shape below would print the
//!   wrong value, or crash, if a release fired while a live name still
//!   referred to the word. The aliasing shapes are the interesting ones: a
//!   `range` whose bound is a *named local* makes the loop's `start_v`,
//!   `stop_v`, and the visible induction target all alias one heap object,
//!   so an unbalanced release there is a use-after-free rather than a leak.
//! * **Peak-RSS ratio.** A missed *release* leaves the leak in place and is
//!   invisible to every value assertion above. The ratio test at the bottom
//!   of this file is the one that fails loudly for it.
