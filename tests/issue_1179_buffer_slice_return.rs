//! Part 2 of #1175 ([#1179](https://github.com/rotnov/pycc/issues/1179)):
//! returning a **sub-range** of a `memoryview` parameter from a public
//! `pycc build --ext` export.
//!
//! Part 1 (#1180) admitted the bare parameter name. Its wrapper decides
//! which argument slot a call returned by comparing the compiled function's
//! result against `&a{index}` -- the `PyccExtBufferView` it filled from
//! `args[index]` -- and then acquires a second, independent buffer export on
//! that argument object. A sub-range breaks that test the naive way round:
//! narrow the returned view inside the callee and the pointer no longer
//! equals any argument slot, so the wrapper can no longer name an owner.
//!
//! This part therefore does not narrow the returned pointer at all. The
//! compiled body still returns `&a{index}`, unchanged, and hands the bounds
//! out of band through three trailing `long long *` out-pointers --
//! `has_slice`, `start`, `stop`. The wrapper runs Part 1's identity test and
//! its PEP 688 second-export check over the **whole** window exactly as
//! before, and only then derives the sub-range host-side, with `PySlice_New`
//! plus `PyObject_GetItem` on the checked `memoryview`. So every safety
//! property Part 1 established holds here verbatim, and CPython -- not
//! pycc -- is what interprets negative, absent, inverted and out-of-range
//! bounds.
//!
//! Two host-side assertions carry the substance and no front-end test can
//! make either:
//!
//! * the derived sub-view still pins the *host's* storage, so
//!   `array.array('d').extend(...)` raises `BufferError` while it is alive
//!   and succeeds once it is released, and `pycc_rt_buffer_live_views` is
//!   zero throughout -- the artifact allocates nothing on this path either;
//! * the bounds CPython applies are Python's own, which is the whole reason
//!   they are derived host-side. `b[-2:]`, `b[3:1]`, `b[0:99]` and
//!   `b[-99:99]` are asserted against what CPython does to a plain
//!   `memoryview`, not against a rule pycc reimplemented.
//!
//! The scope boundary is a `step`-free slice of a **parameter**. A `step`,
//! a slice of artifact-owned storage, and a slice in any position other
//! than the returned expression each stay refused for their own stated
//! reason, and each is pinned below.
