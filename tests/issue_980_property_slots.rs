//! Issue #980: a `@property` getter named `__slots__`, end to end through the
//! public `pycc` CLI.
//!
//! Its own file rather than an addition to
//! `tests/issue_975_reserved_dunder_class_attrs.rs`: that file's module header
//! scopes itself to [D-236]'s instantiation and class-creation protocol names
//! and states that the already-rejected `__slots__` shapes are pinned
//! unchanged there. `__slots__` on the property route is neither -- it is a
//! different name set, a different mechanism, and a behavior change.
//!
//! [D-236]: ../docs/decisions/D-236-reject-a-class-attribute-named-after-the-instantiation.md
//!
//! The defect class is D-198 false acceptance. Measured at `f8e9d2e3` against
//! CPython 3.13.9 (`v3.13.9:8183fa5e3f7`):
//!
//! ```text
//! class C:
//!     @property
//!     def __slots__(self) -> int:
//!         return 1
//! ```
//!
//! CPython raises `TypeError: 'property' object is not iterable` while the
//! `class` statement itself executes -- `type.__new__` iterates `__slots__`
//! at class creation, and a `property` object is not iterable, so the class is
//! never created. pycc accepted the program (`check` exit 0) and ran it. The
//! divergence is value-independent: a `property` is never iterable, whatever
//! the getter returns.
//!
//! Three properties are pinned here:
//!
//! 1. **Both bodies that can reach the route.** A plain and a `@dataclass`
//!    class body share one `MethodKind::PropertyGetter` arm and diverge
//!    identically (both measured). An `Enum` body cannot reach it at all --
//!    `lower_enum_class` rejects a method definition outright first -- which
//!    is why the guard takes no route parameter.
//! 2. **The right account, from both sides.** The message must describe
//!    `type.__new__` iterating `__slots__` at class creation, and must *not*
//!    borrow the plain attribute route's D-154 explanation ("a class's
//!    instance layout is fixed at compile time from its `__init__`"), which
//!    would be a false account of this failure. Emitting that string here is
//!    exactly what #980 was opened to prevent, and a `contains`-only assertion
//!    would not catch it.
//! 3. **No over-rejection.** A benign dunder property stays accepted:
//!    `@property def __doc__(self) -> int` runs and prints `1` under both
//!    engines, so the guard must not grow into "reject every dunder property".
