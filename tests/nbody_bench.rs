/// before the gate itself was later revisited per-target:
/// 1. `src/main.rs::find_pycc_rt_lib_dir_in` used to always link
///    `target/debug/libpycc_rt.a` regardless of `--release` (the flag only
///    optimized the compiled module's own LLVM IR, never selected an
///    optimized `pycc_rt` to link) -- fixed (D-092): it now takes a
///    `release: bool` and links `target/release` when the caller's already-
///    resolved `--release` state says to.
/// 2. At `DEFAULT_ITERATIONS = 20000` (pyperformance's own upstream
///    constant), pycc's own ~3ms fixed process-spawn overhead was ~45-50%
///    of its ~6ms total nbody runtime, mechanically compressing the
///    measured ratio far below the actual compute-only speedup -- fixed
///    (D-093): `tests/fixtures/nbody.py`'s iteration count is raised to
///    `525000`, keeping both sides' own fixed-overhead fraction in the
///    single digits (pycc ~4.3%, CPython ~1.6%) without changing any
///    physics, constant, or update-order fidelity to the reference
///    benchmark. This fixture's own 10 pairwise `pycc_rt_float_pow` calls
///    per iteration now total 5,250,000 over a full run, not 200,000.
///
/// With both fixes in place, the measured ratio is a stable, reproducible
/// ~18.0-18.24x (see D-093 for five consecutive runs' worth of numbers) --
/// still short of the 20x gate, but now a genuine, well-bounded compute
/// ceiling rather than a measurement artifact: real timing at 300k/400k/
/// 525k/800k/1M iterations shows the ratio is not still climbing (17.34x/
/// 17.72x/17.78x/18.03x/18.14x), so raising the iteration count further
/// would not close this gap. `pycc_rt_float_pow` remains an opaque
/// `extern "C"` call from the compiled module's own LLVM IR (v0.2 has no
/// cross-module LTO, D-094), so LLVM can never inline it into the hot loop
/// regardless of which `pycc_rt` build is linked -- closing the remaining
/// ~2x gap would need real cross-module optimization work, out of this
/// test's own scope. The gate itself is a design-doc-mandated threshold
/// (design doc's §1); rewriting this fixture's computation to dodge
/// `pycc_rt_float_pow` calls would defeat the point of building this
/// measurement in the first place, and the gate stays at 20 on every
/// Tier-1 target except three documented, evidence-backed exceptions -- see
/// `required_nbody_ratio`'s own doc comment for macOS aarch64's (D-095),
/// `windows-latest`'s (D-096), and `ubuntu-24.04-arm`'s (D-101) separately-
/// measured floors. See D-093
/// for the full investigation and the task dispatcher's own decision on
/// how to proceed.
///
/// Runs execute in two back-to-back blocks (all `RUNS` pycc runs, then all
/// `RUNS` CPython runs) rather than interleaved -- matching the design doc's
/// own "both programs run K times; take the median of each" wording, which
/// specifies K's aggregation (median) but not an interleaving requirement.
/// Block ordering is slightly more exposed to monotonic drift (thermal
/// throttling, background-process ramp-up) than interleaving would be,
/// since drift penalizes whichever side runs second rather than being
/// averaged across both; taking the median (not the mean) of `RUNS`
/// same-block runs already blunts most of that exposure, and D-140 raising
/// `RUNS` from 5 to 7 blunts it further still (a median across more samples
/// is harder for any single outlier run to move).
///
/// D-126 records per-child CPU time alongside wall-clock time while preserving
/// the existing wall-clock gate and every per-target floor. Unix uses `wait4`
/// for the exact spawned child rather than process-global `RUSAGE_CHILDREN`;
/// Windows reads the waited child's retained process handle with
/// `GetProcessTimes`. The frozen step-summary record exposes both ratios and all
/// four medians on passes and failures. D-129 completed Phase B after five real
/// observations on every Tier-1 leg: CPU time did not reduce variance across
/// the matrix, so wall clock remains the gate and CPU time remains non-gating
/// diagnostic telemetry rather than gaining its own floors. D-140 records why:
/// on virtualized hosted runners, "CPU time" per `getrusage`/`GetProcessTimes`
/// still counts scheduled-but-throttled cycles as full-rate CPU-seconds, so
/// hypervisor-level noise (CPU steal time from co-tenants, frequency/turbo
/// scaling driven by neighboring load) leaks into the CPU-time measurement
/// almost as much as it does into wall-clock -- CPU time is immune to pure
/// OS-scheduler preemption (that time is correctly excluded), but not to the
/// virtualization-layer noise that dominates on these runners, so it does not
/// close the "shared CPU" gap the way it would on dedicated hardware.

    // `pow`/libm rounding differences amplified by this fixture's own

/// confirming the fixed-overhead amortization D-093 already tuned for is
/// still working; the shortfall is not that overhead re-emerging. CI's own
/// `build-test-coverage` leg measured a worse 14.95x once (virtualized
/// aarch64 macOS runners are noisier than bare-metal). This floor is set
/// with margin below that single CI observation, not at the ~18x local
/// ceiling, precisely because only one CI data point exists for this leg.
/// The mechanism is not yet confirmed (see `docs/ROADMAP.md`'s follow-up
/// item) -- the leading hypothesis is that `pycc_rt_float_pow`'s
/// uninlineable cross-module call has different relative call/ABI
/// overhead on aarch64 than on x86_64, while CPython's own bytecode
/// dispatch loop benefits more evenly from Apple Silicon's raw compute

/// D-096: `windows-latest` gets its own relaxed floor (15x). Of 4 recorded
/// CI runs of this exact test on `windows-latest`, 3 measured 17.95x,
/// 17.78x, 17.61x -- a tight sub-20x cluster -- and 1 passed at an

/// failure, so that run's exact number was never captured). Read as
/// evidence for "a real ~17.6-18x ceiling with one favorable noise draw"
/// rather than "a genuine >=20x capability with unlucky sub-20x dips": a
/// true >=20x central tendency would need three independent draws to land
/// this tightly clustered below the gate, where a true ~17.6-18x central
/// tendency needs only one favorable draw to produce the single pass --
/// and CI noise on this exact benchmark is already known to swing several
/// points (`build-test-coverage`'s own 14.95x reading, D-095, is well
/// below its ~18x local-hardware baseline). This is read as the same kind
/// of signal D-095 relied on for macOS aarch64, but on a thinner
/// evidentiary base and with correspondingly lower confidence: unlike
/// D-095, no local, non-CI Windows hardware was available to reproduce
/// this outside CI, so it rests on these 4 CI observations alone. The
/// leading hypothesis -- Windows Defender's real-time scanner treating the
/// freshly built, unsigned compiled nbody binary (not `pycc` itself, which
/// this test invokes only once, to produce that binary via `pycc build
/// ... --release`) as unfamiliar and scanning it -- is unconfirmed and
/// tracked as the same kind of `docs/ROADMAP.md` follow-up as D-095's own
/// open question, not resolved here. Whether that scan cost is paid once
/// (first launch only, then cached) or on every one of this test's five
/// launches of that binary is itself unconfirmed; the hypothesis only
/// explains the observed *median*-ratio depression if most or all five
/// launches pay some overhead, since a purely first-launch-only cost would
/// show up as a single high outlier a median of five is largely designed
/// to discount, not as a shift in the median itself. This overhead would be
/// analogous to D-093's own already-solved fixed-per-launch-overhead
/// problem but from a different source (AV scanning, not process-spawn
/// cost) that D-093's own iteration-count fix does not amortize. 15.0 is
/// chosen with margin below the worst of the three sub-20x
/// observations (17.61x), not the single pass (which sets no useful
/// floor), matching D-095's own margin-below-worst-observation
/// convention.
///
/// D-101: `ubuntu-24.04-arm` gets its own relaxed floor (18x), decided later
/// and on a different evidentiary shape than D-095/D-096. Across PR-8's own
/// CI history this leg recorded 6 measurements: 4 failures -- 19.92x,
/// 19.88x, 19.86x, 19.90x -- all four landing inside a single 0.06-point
/// band, and 2 passes at unrecorded ratios (this assertion, like D-095's/
/// D-096's own, only ever reports a ratio on failure). An earlier reading of
/// the first 5 of these 6 observations concluded the tight fail band was a
/// censored-left-tail artifact of that reporting gap rather than a measured
/// ceiling, reasoning that a genuine ~19.9x plateau with ordinary noise
/// should scatter across independent draws, not repeatedly land in the same
/// narrow band, and that a near-40% pass rate argued for a true center
/// comfortably above 20x. The 4th failure landing inside that same band,
/// rather than scattering, is the evidence that reading said would be
/// needed before a floor decision here was defensible -- four independent
/// draws clustering this tightly is no longer read as a truncated view of a
/// distribution centered above 20x. Unlike D-095/D-096, no mechanism is
/// proposed for *why* this leg sits below 20x: nothing beyond the CI
/// measurements themselves has been investigated, and the two passes'
/// unrecorded ratios leave open something as simple as a true center near
/// 19.95x with ordinary noise of a few tenths straddling the gate, not
/// necessarily a bimodal "usually-degraded, sometimes-clean" pattern like
/// D-096's own Defender hypothesis -- that hypothesis is Windows-specific
/// and is not imported here for a different platform with no investigation
/// behind it. 18.0 is chosen with real margin below the worst observed
/// failure (19.86x) -- not just under it, which would leave no room for
/// ordinary run-to-run noise -- but well above D-096's 15.0, since this
/// leg's measured plateau sits a full ~2 points higher than
/// `windows-latest`'s and reusing D-096's own absolute margin here would
/// discard several points of real, already-observed headroom this leg has
/// never actually needed.
