//! #1130: a subscripted type annotation whose base resolves to a type pycc
//! can name nominally is accepted, with the type argument erased.
//!
//! The rule, stated once and derived from throughout this file:
//!
//! > In **annotation** position, a subscript whose base resolves to a type
//! > pycc can name nominally -- a class in `class_defs`, a `type` alias to
//! > one, or the buffer carrier (`Ty::MemoryView`, any spelling, directly
//! > or through an alias) -- is accepted, with the type argument **erased
//! > without being lowered**. Inside a class's own body the enclosing class's
//! > own name is answered before the six reserved names, so its subscripted
//! > form resolves to that class and is accepted too. A base that resolves to
//! > something that is not a nameable type -- a PEP 695 type parameter,
//! > `Self`, a builtin scalar, or an alias to a non-class `Ty` -- keeps
//! > #931's `T0044`. An undefined base keeps `C0001`; `Any[...]` keeps
//! > `T0002`; a non-bare-name base keeps #889's rejection. **Value position
//! > is unchanged.**
//!
//! Why accepting is right at all: CPython 3.14 evaluates annotations lazily
//! (PEP 649/749), so `class C: pass` + `def f(a: C[int])` raises no
//! `TypeError` at definition time -- that error surfaces only through
//! `typing.get_type_hints`, and pycc builds no runtime `__annotations__`
//! object for any function, class or module, so no pycc-compiled program can
//! reach it. Value position is the opposite: `x = C[int]` is evaluated
//! eagerly and really does raise, so `pycc_types`' value-position path (#610)
//! keeps its own `T0044`. That asymmetry is CPython's own.
//!
//! Scope: this issue admits the subscripted *form*. It does not make any of
//! the #1039 census's 19 array-parameter occurrences compile -- every one of
//! them also needs a name binding that does not exist yet: attribute bases
//! are #889, `import numpy as np` is #883, and `from numpy.typing import ...`
//! is refused by the foreign-import path. (`NDArray` itself was unregistered
//! when this file was written; #1134 has since registered it as a third
//! source spelling of the buffer carrier, which is why the undefined-base
//! regression guard below now names `Nonexistent` instead.)
//!
//! Every test below resolves its answer on the program before `plan_ext`
//! probes the host toolchain, so none is `#[ignore]`d -- except the single
//! hosted arm at the end, which builds an artifact and loads it into a live
//! interpreter, following `tests/issue_1129_ndarray_buffer_carrier.rs`'s own
//! convention for that one shape.
