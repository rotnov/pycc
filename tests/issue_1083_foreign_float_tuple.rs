//! Part 4 of #1026: an annotated module-level assignment of a CPython object
//! to a fixed-arity all-`float` `tuple` (PR 4c of #1083).
//!
//! `tests/issue_1080_foreign_object.rs` owns what a foreign `import` binds
//! and the refusal table around it; `tests/issue_1081_foreign_method_call.rs`
//! owns the method call; `tests/issue_1082_foreign_len_and_truth.rs` owns
//! `len`, truth testing, the subscript load and `for` iteration;
//! `tests/issue_1083_foreign_conversions.rs` owns the four scalar
//! conversions. This file owns the tuple unpack.
//!
//! **Strict container, converting elements.** The shim helper
//! `pycc_ext_obj_unpack_float_tuple` checks `PyTuple_Check` -- not
//! `CheckExact`, so a `tuple` subclass such as a structseq is admitted --
//! with exactly the declared arity, and then converts each item with
//! `PyNumber_Float`. The container half is strict because D-115/D-116 leave
//! no shape for a differently sized sequence: the destination is a by-value
//! LLVM struct of exactly `arity` `double`s, fixed at compile time. The
//! element half converts because the author wrote `float` in the
//! annotation, which is the same explicit-conversion reasoning PR 4a's
//! module doc sets out for `float(o)` -- D-244 rule 7 closes the *thunk
//! export seam*, where a value crosses implicitly, not a conversion the
//! source names. The runtime object's items are therefore never
//! type-checked; a bad item fails at run time with whatever exception
//! CPython's own protocol raises, which
//! `a_non_numeric_item_raises_in_the_host` pins as an ordinary `ValueError`
//! rather than anything pycc invents.
//!
//! **The admission is module-level and annotation-driven only.** PEP 585's
//! variadic `tuple[float, ...]` has no fixed arity and stays refused, as
//! does any mixed annotation; the same statement inside a function body
//! keeps its `I0404`, because `gc` is not in scope as a value there at all.
//! `crates/pycc_types/src/tests/foreign_float_tuple.rs` pins each of those
//! refusals against the checker directly; the tests below pin the two that
//! are worth seeing through the public CLI.
//!
//! The hosted tests contribute no line coverage (CI's coverage job runs
//! `llvm-cov` without `--include-ignored`); they are run by the Tier-1
//! `native-build-test` leg's `cargo test --workspace -- --include-ignored`.
//! Every new Rust line is covered by the non-ignored tests here, by
//! `crates/pycc_codegen/src/foreign_len.rs`'s IR assertions, and by the unit
//! tests in `crates/pycc_types` and `crates/pycc_mir`.
