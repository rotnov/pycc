//! Part 1 of #1027 (#1112): `memoryview` as a pycc type and an `ext`
//! boundary carrier, exercised end to end.
//!
//! The refusal *shapes* -- one per arm of the shim's
//! `pycc_ext_unpack_memoryview`, plus the two buffer-release probes -- are
//! owned by `tests/issue_1067_neg004_ext_conformance.rs`, which is where
//! every other D-244 rule 7 refusal is already pinned against a real
//! interpreter. The closed-set guard that a new carrier cannot be added
//! without a refusal arm is owned by
//! `src/ext_build_tests/refusal_completeness.rs`, and the generated C is
//! pinned by `src/ext_build_tests/generated_c.rs`. What is left, and what
//! this file owns, is the *mode* half of Part 1's statement: the same
//! annotation is admitted by `pycc build --ext` and refused by a native
//! `pycc build`, at both positions it can appear in.
//!
//! Neither mode refusal needs CPython development headers, because both are
//! decided in the frontend before the toolchain is probed, so the two
//! refusal arms below run everywhere. Only the arm that actually builds and
//! loads an artifact is `#[ignore]`d, for the reason every `ext` test is.
//! None of the three contributes line coverage: CI's coverage job runs
//! `llvm-cov` without `--include-ignored` and `scripts/check_diff_coverage.py`
//! excludes `tests/` from its denominator either way.
