//! Issue #984: a non-`@property` `def __slots__` in a class body, end to end
//! through the public `pycc` CLI.
//!
//! Its own file rather than an addition to
//! `tests/issue_980_property_slots.rs`, for the same reason that file is
//! separate from `tests/issue_975_reserved_dunder_class_attrs.rs`: #980's file
//! scopes itself to the `@property` getter route and its own third `__slots__`
//! message, while this is a different set of spellings, a fourth message, a
//! second call site, and a behavior change of its own.
//!
//! The defect class is [D-198] false acceptance. Measured at `e77b4b13`
//! against CPython 3.13.9 (`v3.13.9:8183fa5e3f7`), seven spellings diverged:
//!
//! | shape | CPython 3.13.9 | `pycc check` (before) |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `def __slots__(self)` | `TypeError: 'function' object is not iterable` | accepted |
//! | `@staticmethod def __slots__()` | `TypeError: 'staticmethod' object is not iterable` | accepted |
//! | `@classmethod def __slots__(cls)` | `TypeError: 'classmethod' object is not iterable` | accepted |
//! | `@abstractmethod def __slots__` on an `ABC` | `TypeError: 'function' object is not iterable` | accepted |
//! | `@override def __slots__` | `TypeError: 'function' object is not iterable` | accepted |
//! | `@dataclass` body + `def __slots__` | `TypeError: 'function' object is not iterable` | accepted |
//! | `Protocol` body + `def __slots__` | `TypeError: 'function' object is not iterable` | accepted |
//!
//! In every case CPython exits 1 without creating the class, while `pycc run`
//! printed `1` and exited 0. `type.__new__` iterates `__slots__` while the
//! `class` statement itself executes, and none of those carriers is iterable,
//! so the divergence is value-independent -- whatever the method returns.
//!
//! [D-198]: ../docs/decisions/D-198-treat-a-cpython-divergence-as-a-compiler-defect.md
//!
//! Four properties are pinned here:
//!
//! 1. **Each carrier, named correctly.** CPython names only three types across
//!    all seven spellings, so the message interpolates a carrier resolved from
//!    the binding form rather than carrying one string per spelling.
//! 2. **The right account, from both sides.** The message must describe
//!    `type.__new__` iterating `__slots__` at class creation, and must *not*
//!    borrow the plain attribute route's D-154 explanation ("a class's
//!    instance layout is fixed at compile time from its `__init__`"), which
//!    would be a false account of a class that is never created. A
//!    `contains`-only assertion would not catch that substitution.
//! 3. **Both class-body walks.** A `Protocol` body never reaches
//!    `walk_class_body` -- `lower_class` returns through
//!    `lower_protocol_class` first -- so it needs its own call site, and a fix
//!    that covered only the method loop would leave it falsely accepted.
//! 4. **No over-rejection.** A benign dunder method stays accepted: `def
//!    __doc__(self) -> int` runs and prints `1` under both engines, so the
//!    guard must not grow into "reject every dunder method".
//!
//! `@override def __slots__` is deliberately not tested here: `@override`
//! requires a base class declaring the same name, and that base's own
//! `def __slots__` is rejected first, at the base's line, so any such test
//! would pass for the wrong reason. It binds a plain `function` and folds into
//! the same carrier as the bare `def` in any case.
