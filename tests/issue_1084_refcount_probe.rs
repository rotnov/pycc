//! Part 5 of #1026: what the foreign-object loop shape costs in references.
//!
//! `tests/issue_1084_loop_shape.rs` shows the shape computes the right
//! answer. This file measures the price, and states it as a *differential*
//! invariant rather than an absolute: across a loop of `N` trips, the
//! `sys.getrefcount` of a foreign module attribute grows by exactly
//! `producing_operations * N`, where a producing operation is one that reads
//! the attribute out of the foreign module. The consuming conversion applied
//! to the produced value -- `float`, `bool`, `int`, `str`, `len`, or the
//! fixed-arity tuple unpack -- contributes nothing. Part 4's conversions are
//! therefore clean; what leaks is the attribute load that feeds them.
//!
//! That leak is #1092 (the release protocol for foreign object temporaries),
//! which is open. **When #1092 lands, every absolute below becomes `0`, and
//! the pull request that closes it is expected to edit this test** -- the
//! numbers here are a pin on today's behavior, not a statement that the
//! behavior is correct.
//!
//! **PEP 683 is why the subject looks the way it does.** From CPython 3.12,
//! small integers, `None`, `True`/`False` and interned strings are immortal:
//! `sys.getrefcount(7)` is `4294967295` and never moves. A probe whose stub
//! exported `COUNT = 7` would measure `+0` for every shape at every trip
//! count and prove nothing at all, passing just as happily against a runtime
//! that leaked a reference on every single operation. Every attribute the
//! stub below exports is therefore a mortal object: a `float`, an `int` far
//! outside the small-integer cache, a `tuple`, and an instance of a
//! module-local class.
//!
//! The stub exports more protocol than the probe below reads -- `MESH`
//! carries `__getitem__`, `__iter__` and a `sample` method that no arm here
//! calls -- so that extending the probe to another producing shape needs a
//! change to the loop, not to the fixture. `sample` avoids a
//! container-protocol name deliberately: #1095 tracks container-named methods
//! on a foreign object, and an arm added under such a name would measure that
//! open issue instead of this one.
//!
//! The hosted tests contribute no line coverage (CI's coverage job runs
//! `llvm-cov` without `--include-ignored`) and add no Rust lines outside
//! `tests/`; they are run by the Tier-1 `native-build-test` leg's
//! `cargo test --workspace -- --include-ignored`.
