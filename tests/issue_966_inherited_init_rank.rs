//! #966: an implicit `object`-style constructor ranks **last** in
//! constructor resolution.
//!
//! [D-225] gives every class that declares no `__init__` -- and inherits
//! none through its MRO -- an implicit zero-argument constructor, written
//! into that class's *own* method table. Every constructor walk then took
//! the first `__init__` it met along the MRO, so for `class C(A, B)` with
//! `A` init-less and `B` declaring a real `__init__`, `A`'s implicit stub
//! won and `B.__init__` never ran: `B`'s attribute slots stayed
//! uninitialized and reading one aborted in `pycc_rt`. CPython ranks the
//! equivalent (`object.__init__`) last, and so does pycc now.
//!
//! The two exception-shaped consequences of the same ranking change -- the
//! `class MyError(Base, Exception)` raise becoming legal, and binding that
//! class as a value becoming `C0001` -- are asserted in
//! `tests/issue_912_no_init_class.rs`, which already owns the D-225
//! synthesized-ancestor-constructor surface.
//!
