//! End-to-end coverage for Part B of #1038 (#1064): the converted list, set
//! and float-formatting abort paths.
//!
//! Part A (#1063) converted the four `**` aborts; this file covers the
//! remaining six sites, all of which used to abort the process across a plain
//! `extern "C"` boundary and are now D-173 pending-exception raises:
//! `int_list_slice`'s three rejected bounds (`ValueError`), `int_list_pop` on
//! an empty list (`IndexError`), `float_to_str` outside the
//! `1e-4 <= |x| < 1e16` positional-notation window (`RuntimeError`), and
//! `check_set_len_unchanged` (`RuntimeError`, CPython's own
//! `Set changed size during iteration`).
//!
//! The set site is the one that also needed a codegen change: a D-173 raise
//! returns normally, so `MirStmt::ForSet`'s loop-continue condition gained an
//! `pycc_rt_exception_active() == 0` conjunct. Without it the loop spins
//! forever rather than reporting the error, because the length it compares
//! against is exactly the one the body just grew.
//!
//! Everything here goes through the public `pycc` CLI, mirroring
//! `tests/issue_1063_overflow_error.rs`'s harness. The `ext`-mode test is
//! `#[ignore]`d for the same reason every test in
//! `tests/issue_1050_ext_tuple.rs` is: it asks an installed CPython 3.13+ to
//! import a built artifact, which is a property of the machine. CI runs it on
//! every Tier-1 `native-build-test` leg through that job's
//! `cargo test --workspace -- --include-ignored`. It is deliberately not where
//! line coverage comes from -- the coverage job runs `llvm-cov` without
//! `--include-ignored`.
