//! Part 2 of #1027 (#1113): a bounds-checked native element load from a
//! buffer, exercised end to end.
//!
//! Part 1 (#1112) admitted `memoryview` as an annotation and refused every
//! *use* of such a name. What this part adds is exactly one use -- `b[i]`,
//! reading one `f64` element -- so this file owns the source-level halves
//! that no in-crate unit test can reach: the diagnostics a real program
//! gets for the index position, the refusal that still covers every other
//! use, and the one hosted arm that proves the compiled load agrees with
//! CPython on both the value and the out-of-bounds exception.
//!
//! None of these contributes line coverage: CI's coverage job runs
//! `llvm-cov` without `--include-ignored` and `scripts/check_diff_coverage.py`
//! excludes `tests/` from its denominator either way.
