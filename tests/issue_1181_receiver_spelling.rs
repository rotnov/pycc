//! #1181: an instance method's receiver may be spelled any identifier.
//!
//! Python does not reserve `self` -- it is a PEP 8 convention, and the
//! language binds the first positional parameter of an instance method
//! whatever it is called. pycc used to refuse any other spelling with
//! `C0001`, which made it the third-ranked blocking diagnostic in #1181's
//! own census of a large annotated real-world codebase.
//!
//! `crates/pycc_hir/src/class/receiver.rs` owns the rule and states it once;
//! this file is the public-CLI evidence for it. Every accepted shape is run
//! against its `self`-spelled twin, because the whole claim is that the two
//! compile and run *identically*; every rejected shape asserts the exit
//! status and the reason, so a later change to a guard fails a test rather
//! than silently reopening one of the two wrong answers the guards exist to
//! prevent (see `receiver.rs`'s module doc comment for both).
