//! Part 5 of #1026: the end-to-end loop shape that Parts 1-4 were built for,
//! exercised as one program rather than one operation at a time.
//!
//! Parts 1-4 each pinned a single operation on a foreign `object` value:
//! `tests/issue_1080_foreign_object.rs` owns what a foreign `import` binds,
//! `tests/issue_1081_foreign_method_call.rs` the method call,
//! `tests/issue_1082_foreign_len_and_truth.rs` `len`, truth testing, the
//! subscript load and `for` iteration, and
//! `tests/issue_1083_foreign_conversions.rs` the four scalar conversions and
//! the fixed-arity all-`float` tuple unpack. None of them ran the *shape* the
//! issue was filed for: a module-scope `for` loop that calls a method on a
//! foreign object, unpacks its result into a typed tuple, and accumulates a
//! `float`. This file owns exactly that shape, and
//! `tests/issue_1084_refcount_probe.rs` owns what the shape costs in
//! references.
//!
//! **The differential oracle is valid for this subject, and the reason is
//! narrow.** D-244 rule 7 keeps the type boundary closed at the thunk export
//! seam, where NEG-005 refuses an annotated parameter whose type the exported
//! thunk cannot carry. `total_x()` takes no arguments, so this subject never
//! reaches that deviation, and the compiled artifact is therefore expected to
//! agree with CPython's own execution of the same source *byte for byte*.
//! That is what `the_loop_shape_matches_cpython` asserts. What does not
//! generalize is narrower than "any annotated parameter": D-244's Part 1
//! amendment, statement (e), records that rule 7's conforming-call oracle is
//! unaffected by widening the admitted parameter set, so a subject whose
//! every annotated parameter has a type the thunk *does* carry still has an
//! admissible oracle -- `tests/issue_1114_numpy_oracle.rs` is one, over a
//! `memoryview` and an `int`. It is a parameter whose type the thunk
//! **cannot** carry that reaches NEG-005's deviation and has no oracle,
//! which is why the #1067 harness carries none.
//!
//! **The fixture layout is deliberate.** The foreign stub `pycc_p5_mesh.py`
//! sits in the scratch directory root and the pycc entry module in `src/`
//! beneath it, with both arms run with the scratch root as the working
//! directory. Placing the stub *beside* the entry module instead makes pycc
//! resolve it as a project module and refuse the program with `C0001 module
//! namespace bindings ... not supported yet` -- the import would no longer be
//! foreign, and the test would stop testing #1026. The plain-CPython arm
//! `exec`s the entry module's source in a fresh namespace rather than running
//! it as a script, because a script run would put `src/` at the front of
//! `sys.path` and break the stub's own resolution.
//!
//! The hosted tests contribute no line coverage (CI's coverage job runs
//! `llvm-cov` without `--include-ignored`) and add no Rust lines outside
//! `tests/`; they are run by the Tier-1 `native-build-test` leg's
//! `cargo test --workspace -- --include-ignored`.
