//! NEG-004 (Part E of #1038, #1067): the CPython-driven conformance
//! harness for D-244's host call boundary.
//!
//! D-244 rule 7 says a non-conforming call raises `TypeError` at the
//! wrapper before the compiled body runs, "with no argument mutated and no
//! partial effect left behind". This file is where that sentence is
//! checked against a real interpreter: one `--ext` artifact, then every
//! refusal shape the boundary can produce plus the three properties a
//! single refusal cannot show on its own -- that nothing was left behind,
//! that the export is still correct afterwards, and that a call with two
//! non-conforming arguments names the first one.
//!
//! There is no oracle here, and that is the point. Rule 4's pinned CPython
//! 3.14.7 oracle scopes to *conforming* calls -- what a compiled function
//! computes. A refusal is pycc's own contract at the boundary, so the
//! interpreter in this file is a **loader**, not an oracle: `PYCC_PYTHON`
//! (default `python3`) only has to be a CPython 3.13+ that can import the
//! artifact. Both supported versions must agree, which is why the harness
//! is expected to pass unchanged under `PYCC_PYTHON=python3.14`.
//!
//! `PYCC_PYTHON` is read twice for two different purposes: `src/ext_build.rs`
//! probes it at build time for the development headers, and every `ext`
//! test reads it at run time as the loader. Building against one version
//! and loading on another is `PYCC_PYTHON_INCLUDE`'s job, not this one's.
//!
//! Assertion convention: text pycc authors is asserted **exactly**; text
//! CPython authors is asserted by exception *type* plus a substring both
//! supported versions share. Exactly two shapes below are CPython-authored
//! -- the keyword-argument refusal, which `METH_FASTCALL` dispatch emits
//! before the wrapper is entered at all, and the lone-surrogate
//! `UnicodeEncodeError` from `PyUnicode_AsUTF8AndSize` -- and each carries
//! a comment saying so.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d for the reason every `ext` test is: it asks an installed
//! CPython 3.13+ to import a built artifact, which is a property of the
//! machine. CI runs it twice, on both supported loaders: on every Tier-1
//! `native-build-test` leg against the 3.13 stable-ABI floor, and in
//! `build-test-coverage`'s own `cargo test --workspace -- --include-ignored`
//! step, which runs after that job installs CPython 3.14.7. It is measured
//! in neither, because only that job's earlier `llvm-cov` step is, and that
//! one runs without `--include-ignored`. The completeness guard that *is*
//! inside the coverage denominator lives in
//! `src/ext_build_tests/refusal_completeness.rs`.
//!
//! One `#[test]`, deliberately: each one costs a full `pycc build` on every
//! Tier-1 leg, so the shapes share a single artifact and a single script.
